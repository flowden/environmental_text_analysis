TESTIMONY OF JAY FLETCHER THE CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY and YANKEE GAS SERVICES COMPANY Energy and Technology Committee March 7, 2013 RE: HOUSE BILL NO. 5589, AN ACT ESTABLISHING A PILOT PROGRAM FOR NATURAL GAS TRANSPORTATION Good afternoon. My name is Jay Fletcher, Director of Regulatory Policy for Northeast Utilities Service Company. I am appearing on behalf of The Connecticut Light and Power Company and Yankee Gas Services Company.  Here with me today is Stephen Gibelli, Assistant General Counsel for NUSCO. We support this bill.  Natural gas vehicles, and all alternate fuel vehicles for that matter, provide a potential way for customers to lower the cost of fueling their cars.  One of the impediments to a broader acceptance of natural gas vehicles is a lack of refueling infrastructure. This bill would be a good first step to establishing that infrastructure. We support this legislation, and hope that the State will take further steps to encourage drivers to switch to alternate fuel vehicles. Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on this bill.
