Please vote no on Bill 5363 This Carbon Tax is another way that Connecticut tells the country that it is anti-business. This tax will fall on the citizens of Connecticut who can least afford it and is very regressive. Please look for cost cutting measures to balance the budget. We have enough taxes already. Thomas Costello, CFO The Siemon Company 101 Siemon Company Drive Watertown CT 06795 860-945-4204 office 203-947-3309 cell
