Guerrera, Tony  Subject:  Please Support HJR 1 and Oppose SB 3  March 14, 2016 Dear Representative Guerrera: As you and your colleagues prepare to consider legislation vital to our state's transportation infrastructure and industry, I would like to take a moment to share with you briefly the MetroHartford Alliance's position on two key bills: ¥ Support H.J.R. 1 -Resolution Proposing A State Constitutional Amendment To Protect The Resources Of The Special Transportation Fund We urge you to adopt HJR No. 1 and look forward to working with the Governor, you, and our investors to champion the adoption of a Constitutional amendment on November 8th. It is critical to secure transportation.based revenues for investment in transportation infrastructure, one of our most important assets for sustained economic and employment growth. More details on the Alliance's position can be found in our testimony here. ¥ Oppose S.B. 3 -An Act Concerning the Licensing of New and Used Car Dealers Automotive retailers are significant employers, supporting tens of thousands of jobs in Connecticut. Additionally, Connecticut's motor vehicle franchise model promotes competition and safety, protects consumers, and ensures that automobile repairs are accessible at convenient locations throughout the state. S.B. 3 would create a different set of rules for one company, seriously jeopardizing the future of Connecticut's franchise model, auto dealerships and the 14,000+ jobs they offer. More details on the Alliance's position can be fouánd in a letter to Transportation Committee members here. Thank you for your consideration of these important issues. Sincerely, Patrick McGloin Vice President -Government Relations and Public Policy MetroHartford Alliance 1
