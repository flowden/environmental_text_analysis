We are deeply concerned, however, that this legislative proposal, which essentially establishes a carbon “tax” on fossil fuels, is unnecessary and would serve to harm not only our customers, but also ourstate’s economy as a whole. Natural gas, propane, oil and other fossil fuels are utilized as widespread, efficient and increasingly “clean” energy sources for home and business heating equipment and appliances,so placing a tax on their use and consumption will be harmful to our industry and ourcustomers. Additionally, adding to the price of gasoline through this new tax will impact our contractors’ directly by increasing their costs to operate their service vehicles and equipment. While CHCC supports and promotes various energy efficiency measures and technologies,there is no reasonable amount of efficiency savings that can be achieved in today’s market to offset the potential cost increases on our customers that a carbon tax would impose on theirnecessary fuel sources. Instead of anti-competitive and anti-consumer proposals such as HB-5363, CHCC would encourage the legislature to consider measures that would help us reduce costs, be more competitive and provide job opportunities and learning experiences in the heating and coolingtrades for Connecticut’s future workforce, including the promotion of energy efficiency measures. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Jennifer Jennings Joe DeFusco Executive Director President Organized in 1972, the Connecticut Heating and Cooling Contractors Association is an independent non-profit trade association with membership open to all state licensed merit shop heating, refrigeration and air-conditioning contractors, sheetmetal contractors and plumbers that employ licensed mechanics according to state law.
