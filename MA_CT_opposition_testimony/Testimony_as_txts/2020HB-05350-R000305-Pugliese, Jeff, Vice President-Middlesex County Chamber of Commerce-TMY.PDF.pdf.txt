Our chamber represents businesses from all industry sectors and of all sizes, from Fortune 500 companies, to micro businesses. We are writing today to express the chamber's respectful opposition to H.B. No. 5350, AN ACT CONCERNING NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE. We believe that this proposal would effectively limit future natural gas expansion in communities across the state. This severely limits the options of businesses who are considering expanding, and those who are in the process of planning for their energy future. For many years, our chamber has encouraged the General Assembly to ensure that state policies and plans properly balance the public interests including the needs for safe and adequate water supply, a diverse, balanced energy supply, economic development, public health and safety, recreation and the environment. HB 5350 rnns counter to those goals, and we respectfully urge the legislature to reject this proposal. Thank you for the opportunity to weigh in on this important topic. 393 Main Street, Middletown, CT 06457-3309 ¥ 860-347-6924 ¥ Fax 860-346-1043 http://www.middlesexchamber.com ¥ Email: info@middlesexchamber.com Awards: Governor's Laurel Award for Responsible Social Involvement, President's White House Citation for Private Sector Initiatives U.S.Deportment of Labor LIFTAmerica Award, Connecticut Small BusinessAdvocate Award, Vision 2000 Excellence Award NAACP BusinessAward
