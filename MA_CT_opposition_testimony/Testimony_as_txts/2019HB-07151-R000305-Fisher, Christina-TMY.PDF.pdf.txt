March	5,	2019 Rep.	David	Arconti,	ChairSen.	Norman	Needleman,	ChairJoint	Committee	on	Energy	And	TechnologyConnecticutState	Legislature	Legislative	Office	Building,	Room	3900Hartford,CT	06106 Re:	HB7151-Energy	Efficiency	Standards Dear	Chairs	Arconti	and	Needleman: TechNetis	the	national,	bipartisan	network	of	over	80technology	companies	that	promotes	the	growth	of	the	innovation	economy	by	advocating	a	targeted	policy	agenda	at	the	federal	and	50	state	level.TechNet’s	diverse	membership	includes	dynamicAmerican	businesses	ranging	fromstartups	to	the	most	iconic	companies	on	the	planet	and	represents	more	than	threemillion	employees	in	the	fields	of	information	technology,	e-commerce,	clean	energy,gig	andsharing	economy,	venture	capital,	and	finance.		TechNet	is	committed	to	advancing	the	public	policies	and	private	sector	initiatives	that	make	the	U.S.	the	most	innovative	country	in	the	world. TechNet	respectfully	submits	comments	in	opposition	to	HB	7151	pertaining	to	energy	efficiency	standards.	TechNet’s	member	companies	strive	for	and	pride	themselves	on	offering	highly	efficient	products	for	consumers	and	businesses.		While	we	appreciate	and	support	the	impetus	for	this	legislation,	it	would	be	largely	redundant	to	enact	this	legislation,	particularly	in	regards	to	computers	and	displays.	Connecticut	is	already	receiving	California	compliant	products	since	the	industry	does	not	ship	specific	products	to	specific	states.	No	additional	energy	savings	would	be	granted	withthis	legislation.	Additionally,	this	legislation	does	nottakeinto	account	any	future	adjustments	California	might	make	in	its	effort	to	continue	to	modernize	its	regulations.		The	industry	cannot	risk	having	different	regulations	in	different	states	forthe	same	product.	 TechNet	believes	that	Connecticut	should	rely	on	voluntary	industry	standards	and	existing	international	and	national	standards	rather	than	impose	state-specific	regulations	to	improve	energy	efficiency.	Industry	is	unable	to	support	apatchwork	quilt	of	state	regulations	forproducts	supplied	on	a	national/global	scale.	Current	efficiency	standards	are	already	generating	significant	energy	savings	and	adoptions	is	widespread	across	the	electronic	spectrum. Washington, D.C. • Silicon Valley • San Francisco • Sacramento • Austin • Boston • Olympia • Albany • Tallahassee As	such,	TechNet	respectfully	opposes	HB	7151.	Thank	you	in	advance	for	yourconsideration	on	these	matters.	Please	do	not	hesitate	to	reach	out	with	any	questions. Sincerely, /s/ ChristinaFisher Executive	Director,	NortheastTechNet cfisher@technet.org508-397-4358
