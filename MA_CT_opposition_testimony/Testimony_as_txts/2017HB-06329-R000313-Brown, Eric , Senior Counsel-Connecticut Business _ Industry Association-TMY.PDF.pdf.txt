Testimony of Eric Brown Senior Counsel Connecticut Business & Industry Association before the Environment Committee March 13, 2017 Committee Bill No. 6329: An Act Concerning Hydraulic Fracturing Waste in Connecticut. CBIA opposes this bill The Connecticut Business & Industry Association (CBIA) is disappointed that, in the current economic, energy and legislative climate, this committee is spending valuable time on a measure that serves no practical environmental  purpose to our state (or we and the EPA would argue, to any other).  Rather, this proposal only serves to placate environmental extremists who seek to have state’s in proximity to those economically benefiting from producing natural gas through hydraulic fracturing, ban even the transport of associated wastewaters through their boarders in the hopes of that such strategy will help end the practice of hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is saving businesses and residents around the country billions in energy savings and helping to make our country energy independent.  If we ever have the good fortune in New England to fully avail ourselves of nearby fracked natural gas, our residents and businesses will save billions as well. CBIA recommends the committee expeditiously dispense with this proposal and direct its proponents to focus their efforts in other states that don’t, like Connecticut, have the dubious distinction of being the least competitive state in the nation with respect to energy costs. Thank you for your consideration of our position.
