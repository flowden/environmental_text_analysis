March 6, 2020 To whom it may concern, Section 2(d) of HB 5350 would roll back incentives that have allowed our companies, Southern Connecticut Gas (SCG) and Connecticut Natural Gas (CNG), to bring clean, affordable natural gas to more customers and more communities in Connecticut. Not only have these incentives succeeded in bringing energy choice to customers and reducing carbon emissions, but they have also created thousands of jobs and generated millions of dollars in tax revenues. The legislation would effectively spell an end to SCG and CNG’s plans to bring natural gas to thousands of new residential, commercial and industrial customers in the years ahead — unless those potential customers are willing to foot the lion’s share of the cost to extend gas pipelines to their homes and businesses. Since they were introduced as part of the Connecticut Comprehensive Energy Strategy in 2013, the incentives have made positive contributions to Connecticut’s economic vitality. Contributions within the SCG and CNG service territories include: ·  Investment of $465 million in Connecticut and creation of 6,700 direct and indirect jobs  (job-years).  ·  Conversion of more than 33,000 new SCG and CNG customers, who realize a combined  $28.7 million in annual savings.  ·  Payment of more than $8 million in new municipal tax revenues since 2015.  ·  Support for economic development efforts across the state.  Unfortunately, we believe this proposal would have a detrimental impact on our business community, hamper economic development and stifle customer choice without achieving its intended purpose of reducing carbon emissions in the fight against climate change. Sincerely, Jamison Scott Manufacturing Makes the Future Serving Connecticut Businesses since 1913 701 Hebron Avenue, 3rd Floor  • Glastonbury, CT 06033 • Tel (860) 430-4976 jscott@newhavenmanufacturers.com • www.newhavenmanfacturers.com
