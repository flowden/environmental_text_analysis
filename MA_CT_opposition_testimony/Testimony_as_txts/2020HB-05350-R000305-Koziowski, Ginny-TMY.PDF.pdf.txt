REGIONAL ECONOMIC XCELLERATION Testimony of Ginny Kozlowski, Executive Director of REX Development in Opposition to H.B. No. 5350: AN ACT CONCERNINGNATURAL GAS. Energy & Technology Public Hearing Thursday, March 5, 2020 March 2, 2020 Senator Needleman, Representative Arconti, Senator Lesser, Representative Allie-Brennan and members of the Energy & Technology committee, thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in opposition of H.B. No. 5350: AN ACT CONCERNING NATURAL GAS. I, in my role as Executive Director of REX Development, am asking that you oppose passage of this bill. The purpose of REX Development is to retain and recruit businesses to South Central Connecticut. To support this goal, we specifically recommend the expansion of natural gas mains in our Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (the document can be reviewed on www.rexdevelopment.com). The retention and recruitment of businesses are essential for the economic success of Connecticut. Our region thrives on knowledge-based industries that are often high energy users. Additionally, small businesses (50 employees or less) account for nearly 50% of the region's employment. We cannot make gas access for these ..I¥ customers cost-prohibitive, eliminating a reliable, efficient and desired low-cost energy option. <( 1.Currently, natural gas is the most efficient energy source widely available for businesses. While we strongly z support the continued exploration and implementation of green energy solutions, we cannot let the perfect La.I stand in the way of the good. I strongly urge the committee region. f.0 .a. to oppose this bill and encourage economic growth in the greater New Haven C LLI f.-l: ..J z ::) ¥(I) z ==0 f.in-¥z 0 C) La.I PO Box 1576 New Haven, CT 06506 0:: T 203 1321 36132 WW11'. .rexdeve!opmentcom LLI zBETHANY BRANFORD EAST HAVEN GUILFORD HAMDEN MADISON MERIDEN MILFORD NEW HAVEN NORTH BRANFORD NORTH HAVEN ORANGE WALLINGFORD WEST HAVEN WOODBRIDGE 0
