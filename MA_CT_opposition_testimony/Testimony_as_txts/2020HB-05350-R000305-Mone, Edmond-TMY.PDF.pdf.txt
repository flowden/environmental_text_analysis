Co Chairs Senator Needleman Representative Arconti Ranking Members Senator Formica Representative Ferraro Respectfully I submit to take exception to specific language in this proposed bill that can be found in the paragraph as new language at line 106d and specifically on line 111 as it relates to “hurdle” rate of recovery. This language makes arbitrary that amount of time that the Utility can recover capital costs as it relates to natural gas installation lines. My understanding is that previous “hurdle” time frame was established at 25 years and as such should remain at that time frame. Natural gas is a cost effective energy source that can be used by residential, industrial, commercial and municipal entities as low polluting energy source and as such should continue to be promoted. Particularly as it relates to new construction, a reduction in the time frame could negatively impact those who would prefer to exercise that option when it is being offered. For both the environmental and economic reasons, I stand opposed to this specific section of bill HB 5030 and recommend it be either struck or modified. Sincerely, Edmond V.
