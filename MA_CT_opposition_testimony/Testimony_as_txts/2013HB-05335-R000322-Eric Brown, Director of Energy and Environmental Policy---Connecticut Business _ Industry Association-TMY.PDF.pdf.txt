CBIA_EPC_header_2012TESTIMONY OF ERIC J. BROWN ASSOCIATE COUNSEL, DIRECTOR OF ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY CONNECTICUT BUSINESS & INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION before the ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE March 22, 2013 Good morning.  My name is Eric Brown and I serve as director of energy and environmental policy with the Connecticut Business &IndustryAssociation (“CBIA”).  On behalf of our 10,000 large and small member companies throughout Connecticut, we appreciate this opportunity to share our perspective regarding: H.B. 5335: AN ACT PROHIBITING THE POSSESSION AND STORAGE OF FRACKING BY-PRODUCTS CBIA opposes this bill Hydraulic fracturing wastes, like any waste material, need to be properly managed and, where technologically and economically feasible, reused and recycled to mitigate the need for environmental or public health exposure. Despite the fact that no hydraulic fracturing occurs or is foreseeable in Connecticut, this bill would prohibit the possession or storage of any material that is produced or generated as the result of conducting hydraulic fracturing.  In short, this bill would treat hydraulic fracturing wastes as a more serious health and environmental threat than spent nuclear fuel rods.. Additionally, if every state in the union adopted such a measure, it would effectively foreclose the opportunity for our state and our nation to take advantage of vast domestic, clean and affordable energy available to us through the use of hydraulic fracturing technology. Surely, Connecticut’s legislature does not wish to advance such an agenda. Accordingly, CBIA respectfully requests your rejection of this H.B. 5335. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this bill and for your consideration of our position.
