My name is Joann Basile and I reside in Plymouth. I am at retirement age now and am seriously considering selling my home in CT to move to FL where it is much affordable for Senior citizens and actually for any CT residents. I was born in CT and have resided in CT my whole life. My roots and family are also here in CT. Should Bill 5363 get passed I am confident that it will only further open the door for residents who have been contemplating moving out of CT to take that step, myself included. Please vote NO.
