RIGREATER t;1NEWHAVEN ~CHAMBER We take care of business. Energy & Technology Committee Public Hearing Thursday, March 5, 2020 Senator Needleman, Representative Arconti, Senator Formica, Representative Ferraro, and members of the Energy & Technology Committee, thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in opposition to HOUSE BILL 5350, AN ACT CONCERNING NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE. On behalf of the members of the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce and Quinnipiac Chamber of Commerce, I ask that you oppose passage of House Bill 5350. Connecticut is a high cost state in many areas, including energy. Passing a bill that limits natural gas expansion and ultimately fuel choice for business customers will only further increase energy costs. Supporting the economic growth of the New Haven Region is part of the mission of the Chamber. This bill would limit the length of time a natural gas utility has to recover its investments from natural gas expansion. As a result, it will make increasing gas access for customers cost-prohibitive, eliminating a reliable, efficient and desired low-cost energy option. We are at a point in time when we are trying to grow our economy and add jobs. Shutting down natural gas expansion does not benefit our businesses or our overall economy. Please oppose H.B. 5350. Thank you for your consideration. Chair, Board of Directors 900 Cha11el I011noor. lloven I 203 787 I fax 203 782 I gnhcc.com Strcc1.
