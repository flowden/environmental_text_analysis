Dear Energy & Technology Committee, Please oppose HB 5008: An Act Concerning The Establishment Of High Performance Green Building Standards For Voluntary Adoption By Municipalities. If passed, this bill will increase the cost of construction in towns that adopt these “stretch codes” and negatively impact housing affordability which is already a problem in CT. The current code process works well as proposed changes are reviewed by the Codes and Standards Committee prior to adoption. This proposed bill is truly unnecessary and will allow DEEP to create codes without public scrutiny or oversight and without consideration to affordability, health and safety and other important considerations. Having a single statewide code is important for the industry as is creates a predictable environment in which to do business. Our current statutes already require that the Codes and Standards Committee to take energy efficiency and resiliency into consideration when adopting codes. New homes are more energy efficient or more resilient than ever. The current system allows for code modification requests and an appeal process to the State Building Official. There would be no such process if this important process is turned over to DEEP. Municipalities wishing to limit or restrict affordably housing could easily apply these high performance standards on all new homes as a way of driving the costs up to discourage the construction of affordable homes in their communities. For theses reasons, I ask that you please oppose this unnecessary and expensive legislation. Sincerely, Robert Wiedenmann Robert G.
