Fuel companies pay for the products and other costs within 10 days but have historically offered net 30 day terms to their customers. With the additional tax burden State Line will no longer be able to offer terms to a majority of our customers. This will force our customers to become COD and no longer be able to stretch those costs over 30 days or even over 10-12 month budget cycles. This will add a severe tax burden on consumers for the basic necessity of heating their homes adding to the financial stress of those already struggling to afford to live in Connecticut.
