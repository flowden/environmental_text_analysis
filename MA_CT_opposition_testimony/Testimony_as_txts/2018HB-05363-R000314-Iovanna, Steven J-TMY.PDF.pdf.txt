Good morning Another day another email required to oppose ANOTHER tax on the people of the State of Connecticut! I am writing to oppose Bill 5363 -the Carbon Tax. I believe this bill would put another burden on seniors, people on fixed incomes, young families, and virtually everyone in Connecticut. Why is it that the ideas being proposed in our capitol for new ways to tax us and increase revenue are seemingly endless, while the ideas on cutting spending, balancing our budget and becoming fiscally responsible are few and far between (to say the least). Please accept this email as my STRONG opposition to Bill 5363! Thank you. Steve Steven J. Iovanna ARCHITECT Meriden, CT (203) 694-4894
