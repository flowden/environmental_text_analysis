ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE March 14, 2018 The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities (CCM) is Connecticut’s statewide association of towns and cities and the voice of local government -your partners in governing Connecticut. Our members represent over 96% of Connecticut’s population. We appreciate the opportunity to testify on bills of interest to towns and cities. SB 345 “An Act Concerning Climate Change Education In Connecticut Schools” SB 345 would mandate Connecticut schools to teach climate change consistent with the Next Generation Science Standards adopted by the State Board of Education. CCM has concerns with SB 345 as it is an unfunded mandate. Every year, therearemultiple pieces of proposed legislation to add new requirements to public school curriculums. Each new mandated curriculum passed down fromthe state to local school districts only decreases the already minimal amount of time educators have to work with their students on the core curriculum– math, science, English, and social studies. CCM urges the committee to oppose SB 345. If you have any questions, please contact Donna Hamzy, Advocacy Manager of CCM at dhamzy@ccm-ct.org or (203) 843-0705.
