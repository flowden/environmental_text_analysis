No carbon tax! CT certainty does not need another tax, especially a carbon tax. Who thinks up these ridiculous ideas of taxation. The state economy is not going to improve by taxing us more, it's just going to drain the citizen's wallets and drive more people out of CT. Enough with desperation taxes!!! Steven Zacchio Cromwell
