Bridgeport Regional Business Council Dan Onofrio -President & CEO March 5, 2020 TESTIMONY: Energy & Technology Committee House Bill 5350 -An Act Concerning Natural Gas Infrastructure On behalf of your Bridgeport Regional Business Council, please accept this testimony against House Bill 5350 -An Act Concerning Natural Gas Infrastructure. Our concerns lie specifically with Section 3 of the raised bill, which will limit the length of time (by changing the "hurdle rate") a natural gas utility can recover its investments from natural gas expansion to residents and businesses in this state. The Bridgeport Regional Business Council and our affiliates of the Bridgeport, Stratford and Trumbull Chambers of Commerce is a business membership organization, comprised of over 600 area businesses, serving the Greater Bridgeport region. We are the leader for local and regional economic development efforts. If House Bill 5350 is passed with the existing language, it will increasingly make the availability of natural gas to homes and neighborhoods in Connecticut communities cost-prohibitive, thus eliminating a reliable, efficient and desired lower.cost energy option -and in turn, create a very negative message to both residents and potential and existing businesses. While combatting climate change and addressing our energy challenges are a pressing priority for everyone in this state, this proposal would have a devastating impact on our business community, our residents, and negatively impact economic development opportunities, including business growth and availability of affordable housing. A proposal that would significantly increase utility costs without reducing greenhouse gas emissions is not a solution. For these reasons, we oppose raise House Bill 5350 -An Act Concerning Natural Gas Infrastructure. For more information, please contact me at 203.335.3800. Dan Onofrio President & CEO Bridgeport Regional Business Council Bridgeport, Stratford, Trumbull Chambers of Commerce
