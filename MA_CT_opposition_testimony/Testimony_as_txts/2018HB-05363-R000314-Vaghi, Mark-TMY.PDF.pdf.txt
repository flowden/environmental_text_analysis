What will be the next thing the State of Connecticut will attempt to tax??? Will it be the rainwater/snow that falls on our property and seeps into our wells? Will it be the amount of sunshine that falls upon our neighborhoods each day providing us with warmth?? This list could be endless. I SAY NO TO THE CARBON TAX. I would like to see the state become more fiscally responsible and find ways of cutting the excessive waste that seems to perminate from Hartford on a continuous bases. The last several tax hikes did not solve a thing. The unquenchable thirst of the Democratic leadership in Hartford to tax and spend every hard earned dollar the overtaxed people of Connecticut sends them has got to END! Mark Vaghi Woodbury, Connecticut
