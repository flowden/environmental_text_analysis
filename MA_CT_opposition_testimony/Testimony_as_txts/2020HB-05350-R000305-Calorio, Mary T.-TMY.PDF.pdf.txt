TOWN OF KILLINGLY Office of the Town Manager 172 Main Street, Killingly, CT 06239 Tel: 860 779-5335 Fax: 860 779-5394 March 4, 2020 Dear Members of the Energy & Technology Committee As a community leader in the Town of Killingly, I wish to express my opposition to Raised Bill No. 5350. As proposed, this bill would effectively limit future natural gas expansion in Connecticut, forcing those who are not already benefitting from natural gas to use more expensive energy sources for heating, cooling and cooking. Raised Bill No. 5350 will eliminate the ability for those customers who do not yet benefit from natural gas to choose the best way to heat their homes or business. Natural gas remains the most reliable and affordable source of energy in Connecticut and helps keep the operating costs of municipal buildings and schools low, benefitting taxpayers. While natural gas is available in many areas, it's important that all our residents and businesses, no matter where they are located, have the opportunity to save on their energy costs. By limiting the future gas expansion in Connecticut, Raised Bill No. 5350 as proposed, would negatively impact the economic development necessary to sustain and grow our municipalities further increasing our taxes. At a time when Connecticut continues to pay some of the nation's highest energy costs, I believe this proposal is short-sighted. Please vote no on Raised Bill No. 5350. Ill -l Mary T.
