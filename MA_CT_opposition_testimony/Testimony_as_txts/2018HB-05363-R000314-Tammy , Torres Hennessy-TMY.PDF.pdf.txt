NO, NO, NO! NO Carbon Tax on Connecticut! This is a devastating idea; to tax us again after we already pay for fuel taxes, home heating oil , etc. and have the highest energy costs in the country. This is double taxation on a populous who are already TAXED TO DEATH! Start reining in the budget, the state pensions, generational welfare recipients, etc. Put prisoners to work on chain gangs and let them fix our roads, bridges, clean garbage, graffiti, and blight. stop GIVING away the farm I've lived here all my life and can't wait to LEAVE! Sincerely, Tammy Torres Hennessy 79 Hawley Road Oxford,CT
