To whom it may concern: I am a retired person living here in the God forsaken State of Ct. and I am writing to express my displeasure and dismay over the proposed carbon tax!!! As s retiree I live on a fixed income and have to decide between medications, food, heat,bill paying etc. How in the world are we expected to live while being crushed under the burden of increased taxation???? Maybe that's the agenda, welcome illegal immigrants that the state will support and let us elderly die of starvation!!!! Please vote no on this proposed bill!!
