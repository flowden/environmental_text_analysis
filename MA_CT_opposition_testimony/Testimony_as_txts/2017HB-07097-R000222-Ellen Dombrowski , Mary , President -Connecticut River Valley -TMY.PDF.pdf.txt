March 6, 2017 Connecticut General Assembly Transportation Committee The Honorable Antonio Guerrera, House Co-Chair The Honorable Carlo Leone, Senate Co-Chair The Honorable Toni Boucher, Senate Co-Chair Legislative Office Building Room 2300 Hartford, CT  06106 Re: Opposition to H.B. 7097 - AN ACT CONCERNING THE LICENSING OF NEW AND USED CAR DEALERS Dear Chairmen: The ConnecticutRiver Valley Chamber of Commerce represents over 600 businesses based primarilyin East Hartford and Glastonbury. Our membership ranges from home-based businesses to the largest manufacturer in East Hartford. Among our members are several automobile retailers,significant taxpayers, who oppose this measure. The Chamber strongly opposes H.B. 7097 as its passage would seriously jeopardize the successful, long-standing franchise model. The passage of such ameasure would impact over 14,000 Connecticut employees in the automobile sector as it currently exists. Tesla has the opportunityto work within Connecticut’s franchise system and compete in an already level playing field. Should HB 7097 be passed, the door opens for Tesla to sell directly to consumers whichbypasses the current franchise laws. Our state is NOTin a position to compromise jobs, local businesses or tax revenue. We strongly urge you to oppose H.B 7097; thankyou for your consideration. Sincerely, MaryEllen Dombrowski President 2400Main Street (860)659-3587 1137Main Street Glastonbury, CT06033 www.crvchamber.org East Hartford,CT06108
