I am strongly against a carbon tax. I have 70 trucks on the road in Connecticut. I am at my the end of my rope with taxes in Connecticut. It seems the state is doing everything they can to chase people away including me. Don;t you understand that people travel and see what it’s like in other states? Then they want to move there. I am on the bubble. I also have 380 employees. You guys don’t get it, but when you see my taillights I won’t care if you do or not. STOP SPENDING! Reduce the state work force!
