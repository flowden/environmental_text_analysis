ENERGY & TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE March 7, 2013 The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities (CCM) is Connecticut’s statewide association of towns and cities and the voice of local government - your partners in governing Connecticut.  Our members represent over 92% of Connecticut’s population. We appreciate the opportunity to testify on bills of interest to towns and cities. CCM supports HB 5589 “An Act Establishing a Pilot Program for Natural Gas Transportation” The proposal would require the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to establish a natural gas transportation pilot program to encourage the conversion of municipal vehicle fleets to natural gas and to develop additional natural gas refueling stations within the State. CCM supports this as a way to reduce carbon emissions produced from motor vehicles.  This proposal is currently only in concept form.  As it becomes more fully developed and vetted, CCM encourages that this program is properly funded and can provide long term assistance to towns and cities that decide to join the program and no new mandates are placed on municipalities. CCM urges the committee to support this concept. If you have any questions, please contact Mike Muszynski, Legislative Associate at (mmuszynski@ccm-ct.org) or via phone (203) 500-7556.
