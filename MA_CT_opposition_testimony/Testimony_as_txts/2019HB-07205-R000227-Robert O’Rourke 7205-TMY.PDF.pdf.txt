Robert O’Rourke 211 Carmen Hill Road New Milford, CT 06776 TRAtestimony@cga.ct.gov. Connecticut General Assembly c/o Hartford Connecticut via email submission Re: 7202 and 7280 Tolls To whom it may concern: I am writing to advise you that we, as taxpayers here in Connecticut, can no longer absorb any further tax increases and want our elected officials to avoid increasing taxes through tolls. Our governor ran on a platform of no auto tolls and now he’s doing a 180 degree flip on his position, much the same has his predecessor did last time. How long can we keep increasing spending and not look at chasing hard working people out of our state to more reasonable areas of our country. As a retired person, how do you think we can continue to live here and afford to pay these ridiculous fees, taxes, surcharges or call it what you like, more of my money being wasted in Hartford? Please refrain from even presenting this bill as we cannot afford this kind of increase. More than likely the monies will not even go toward repairing our infrastructure but rather be wasted on more increasing giveaway programs that we can no longer afford. Thank you for listening, Robert O’Rourke c/c  State Representative Bill Buckbee
