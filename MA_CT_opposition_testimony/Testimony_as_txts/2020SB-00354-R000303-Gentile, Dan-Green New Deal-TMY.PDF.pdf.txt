I don’t know why it’s in labor this was an environmental bill and has anyone looked at the environmental impact 20 years from now with solar panels taken down they can’t get rid of Wind turbines. When these bills are voted on no one‘s looking into the future and what is the environmental decimation is. Sent from my iPhone 1
