We oppose the bill because it will be harmful to Connecticut's economy not only because of our high electricity costs due in large part to natural gas pipeline constraints, but it will take away an important tool to address those costly constraints. As many of you know, interstates natural gas pipelines are highly regulated from the time they are proposed for improvement, through to their construction and on an ongoing basis. Our working men and women who have worked on pipelines, power houses and local gas distribution lines take their work very seriously and are vigilant that they do so with utmost care for the environment. Please preserve this law so that Connecticut and the other New England states have a fighting chance to improve our interstate pipeline system to deliver cleaner, cheaper and more reliable energy. I look forward to answering any questions you might have, thank you for your consideration.
