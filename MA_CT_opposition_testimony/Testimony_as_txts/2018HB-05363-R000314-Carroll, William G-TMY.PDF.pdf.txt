Subject Carbon Tax -Bill 5363 -Vote No on a Carbon Tax The people of CT are already burdened with heavy taxes on energy and to place a Carbon Tax which will drive up the cost of energy in CT is simply morally wrong. A Carbon Tax will have a negative input on CT businesses which will be forced to pass the tax on to consumers, which will drive up the cost of living in CT. I urge the CT state legislature to vote down Carbon Tax bill 5363 a needless tax. CT is already awash with taxes and to impose another useless tax such as the Carbon Tax will just hurt the people of CT. William G. Carroll Cheshire, CT 06410
