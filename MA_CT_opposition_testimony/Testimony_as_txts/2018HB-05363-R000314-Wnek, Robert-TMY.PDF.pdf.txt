Dear Sir; I am strongly opposed to Bill 5363 that would create a “Carbon Tax” in Connecticut. This proposal will drive more businesses and residents out of the State and add to our already excessive Tax burden. When will the Legislature and Governor recognize that Connecticut does not have a revenue shortfall, but does have an excessive spending problem. We need to cut the excessive waste and get the costs we pay for services under control. Only then will the beautiful State of Connecticut regain its stature as one of the best States to reside in. Regards, Robert Wnek Prospect, CT
