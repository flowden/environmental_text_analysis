Greetings, Regretfully I am probably too late with my testimony. For many years, promises have come out of Hartford that our legislature we spend wisely, protect jobs, improve the economy and not raise taxes. Each of these has been a lie. The guarantees that come out of Hartford are lies and more taxes. Until the legislature can reduce the bloat and waste in every department and agency, the CGA should not consider raising a single tax, consider adding a single tax, consider adding another unfunded mandate to a single person, business, or municipality. It is disgusting how poorly the elected officials of our state conduct business and how much damage they have done to tax payers and the Connecticut citizenry as a whole. In summary, please vote NO on Bill 5363. Thank you, Robert Makowski Watertown, CT
