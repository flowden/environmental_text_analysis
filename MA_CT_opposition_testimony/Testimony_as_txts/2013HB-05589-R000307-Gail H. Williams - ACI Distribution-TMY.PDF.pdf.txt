March 7, 2013 Good Morning Co Chairs Duff and Reed and to all of the other Members of the Energy and Technology Committee!  Thank you for the opportunity to offer my written testimony in support of Senate Bill 5589 .AN ACT ESTABLISHING A PILOT PROGRAM FOR NATURAL GAS TRANSPORTATION. I would like to offer a special thank you to Representative Carter for his diligence in moving this important legislation forward to you and the various committees prior to your Committees consideration.  My name is Gail H. Williams, and I am the owner of a company called ACI Distribution. ACI Distribution is a Connecticut based certified minority woman owned company that is a distributor of natural gas fueled fleet vehicles and a sustainable transportation solutions company. The reason for my company’s involvement in alternate fuel is my company’s goal is to push our commitment to sustainability beyond the confines of “business as usual.” By passing Senate Bill 5589 -AN ACT ESTABLISHING A PILOT PROGRAM FOR NATURAL GAS TRANSPORTATION you support me in doing just that.  The passage of this bill will not only save municipalities money but you will also be encouraging taxpaying entities to become environmentally responsible and you will potentially offer a tremendous opportunity for my small business for growth. But most importantly you be providing an opportunity for the State of Connecticut to increase its tax revenues and create a new revenue stream for the Municipality. Interestingly enough, based on the anticipated demand for alternative fuel vehicles, there are many vehicles that are now available for purchase in addition to the various Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) models. Many vehicles are being converted offline, but still carry the Manufacturer’s warranty which provides many options to all parties that want to buy Natural Gas Vehicles that did not exist before.  Because of these various options it will make it more appealing for the Municipality and others to migrate their fleets to Compressed Natural Gas. Keep in mind that once the municipalities move to Natural Gas Vehicles and builds CNG Infrastructure they will receive the following benefits: . Lower operating costs from fuel savings. . Operation of more efficient vehicles. . Reduced capital costs. . Elimination of older and inefficient vehicles. . Improved local air quality. . Support for local economies by buying fleet-related products and services that are            made locally. . Investment in a green economy based on the fundamental principles of clean energy,            and good jobs. . Opportunity to show leadership on environmental issues and meet municipal            environmental goals. . Increase tax revenues for the State of Connecticut. . Create new revenue stream for Municipalities from CNG Infrastructure fuel sales. With all this said, I strongly urge you to pass Senate Bill 5589, and with special attention to including “vehicles that are converted offline.” By remembering this small detail you will broaden the audience who will benefit from this legislation, and offer more options to taxpayers that can fuel up at these municipal stations. Thank you in advance for your consideration. Sincerely, Gail H. Williams 34-2 Grand Street, Danbury, CT 06810 (914) 396-7473www.alegrecommunications.com_going_ green
