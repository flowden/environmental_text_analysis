Dear Env Representative, Vote NO to Bill 5363. Do not allow a carbon tax to be passed. Every tax whether individual or corporate are ALL paid by the citizens. Tax companies and they raise the cost their product.  End result, another tax paid for by the citzenry. The Bill also presents the concept of a Dividend “pay-back” to CT citizens and families. This increases administrative costs, increases complexity, and provides another place Gov Malloy to “take” from. Save our state government the extra costs of administrating this program and further burdening the citizenry. Stop pushing your clean energy agenda by punishing the citizens with increased living costs. We do not want governement calling the shots.  Its the people who are supposed to calling the shots. I remind you, the purpose of government is FOR THE PEOPLE and BY THE PEOPLE. Get your hands out of our pockets! Tell Gov Malloy he will have to manage to the budget he has. Stop allowing him to bring the citizens of CT into poverty because over taxation. Vote NO to Bill 5356. Respectfully Submitted, Melissa Stubbs Meridn, CT
