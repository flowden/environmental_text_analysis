I am totally opposed to Bill 5363 that would impose a "Carbon Tax" on the citizens of our state. I am a retired private sector employee without a defined pension and struggling with my wife to make ends meet. Last year we spent $20,300 on medical costs even though we had no serious health problems. Most of that cost was for medical insurance for my wife who is not yet 65 and for my Medicare costs. Oh, how we wish I had the overly extravagant benefits of Connecticut's public employees!! We cannot afford increased carbon taxes on our heating and fuel costs. Stop placing the burden of running our government on the backs of senior citizens. Vote NO on Bill 5363. Peter J. Rzasa Woodcrest Road Seymour, Ct 06483
