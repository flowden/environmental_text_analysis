BROWN ASSOCIATE COUNSEL, DIRECTOR OF ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY CONNECTICUT BUSINESS & INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION before the ENERGY & TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE March 7, 2013 Good morning.  My name is Eric Brown and I serve as director of energy and environmental policy with the Connecticut Business & Industry Association (“CBIA”).  On behalf of our 10,000 large and small member companies throughout Connecticut, we appreciate this opportunity to share our perspective regarding: H.B.6533: AN ACT CONCERNING HYDRAULIC FRACTURING CBIA opposes this bill Hydraulic fracturing wastes, like any waste material, needs to be properly managed and, where technologically and economically feasible, reused and recycled to mitigate the need for environmental or public health exposure. Despite the fact that no hydraulic fracturing occurs or is foreseeable in Connecticut, this bill would ban any activity related to hydraulic fracturing wastes including, storing, recycling, neutralizing potential environmental or health risks associated with these wastes, or reusing them in accordance with any permitting or regulatory measures that exist currently or may exist in the future. In short, this bill would treat hydraulic fracturing wastes as a more serious health and environmental threat than spent nuclear fuel rods. Additionally, if every state in the union adopted such a measure, it would effectively foreclose the opportunity for our state and our nation to take advantage of vast domestic, clean and affordable energy available to us through the use of hydraulic fracturing technology. Surely, Connecticut’s legislature does not wish to advance such an agenda. Whatever the intent, CBIA respectfully urges your rejection of this bill.
