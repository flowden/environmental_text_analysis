February	27,	2020 Sen.	Norman	Needleman,	ChairRep.DavidArconti,	Chair	JointCommitteeEnergyandTechnologyLegislative	Office	Building,	Room	3900Hartford,	CT	06106 Re: SB	 178-Energy	 Efficiency	Standards DearChairs	Needleman	and	Arconti	and	members	of	the	Committee: TechNetis	the	national,	bipartisan	network	of	over	80technology	companies	that	promotes	the	growth	of	the	innovation	economy	by	advocating	a	targeted	policy	agenda	at	the	federal	and50state	level.TechNet’s	diverse	membership	includes	dynamicAmericanbusinesses	ranging	fromstartups	to	the	most	iconic	companies	on	the	planetandrepresents	morethanthreemillion	employeesin	thefieldsofinformation	technology,e-commerce,	clean	energy,	gig	and	sharing	economy,	venture	capital,	and	finance.		TechNet	is	committed	to	advancing	the	public	policies	and	private	sector	initiatives	that	make	the	U.S.	the	most	innovativecountry	in	the	world. TechNet	respectfully	submits	these	commentsin	opposition	to	SB	178,	legislation	pertaining	to	energy	efficiency	appliance	standards.	TechNet’s	member	companies	strive	for	and	pride	themselves	on	offering	highly	efficient	products	for	consumers	and	businesses.		While	we	appreciate	and	support	the	impetus	for	this	legislation,	it	would	be	largely	redundant	to	enact	this	legislation.	 TechNet	believes	thatConnecticutshould	rely	on	voluntary	industry	standards	and	existing	international	and	national	standards	rather	than	impose	state-specific	regulations	to	improve	energy	efficiency.	Industry	is	unable	to	support	a	patchwork	quilt	of	state	regulations	for	products	supplied	on	a	national/global	scale.	Current	efficiency	standards	are	already	generating	significant	energy	savings	and	adoptions	is	widespread. While	the	legislation	references	California	legislationfor	IT	productsand	allows	theCommissioner	to	update	regulations	to	mirror	California,	the	legislation	is	permissive	and	not	required	for	the	Commissioner	to	do	so.		The	industry	cannot	risk	having	different	regulations	in	different	states	for	the	same	product.	We	strongly	encourage	you	consider	stronger	language	torequirethe	Commissioner	to	update	regulations	when	andif	California	updates	regulationsfor	IT	products.	 Washington, D.C. • Silicon Valley • San Francisco • Sacramento • Austin • Boston • Olympia • Albany • Tallahassee Additionally,	our	members	also	have	concerns	with	several	lighting	definitions.	An	example	of	is	the	definition	of	“general	service	lamp”	(GSLs),the	regulation	ofwhich	is	preempted	by	Federallaw.TheDepartment	of	Energy	has	stated	this	at84	FR	46669: “Therefore,	all	states,	including	California	and	Nevada,	are	prohibited	from	adopting	energy	conservation	standards	for	GSLs.”As	such,	we	strongly	urge	you	to	remove	this	definition	and	theGSLefficacystandards	from	the	bill.	 We	are	also	concerned	with	definitions	for	“cold	temperature	lamp”	and	“impact	resistant	lamp”.	Few	TLEDs	offer	a	rated	operating	temperature	as	low	as	-20F	thatthe	definition	of	‘cold	 temperature’	lamps	requires	in	the	bill. Most	manufacturers	go	to	-4F. A	-20F	rating	would	 require	a	completely	new	design	to	guarantee	reliable	starting	at	-20F.TLED	products	are	alsonot	inherently	more	impact	resistant	thanlinear	fluorescent	products. Some	now	are	 constructed	of	glass	rather	than	plastic.Additionally,	the	volume	forboththese	type	of	lamps	is	very	low,	thus	the	potential	for	significant	energy	savings	is	low. Finally,TechNet	is	concerned	that	the	proposed	definition	of	“electric	vehicle	supply	equipment”	conflicts	withhow	the	technology	is	defined	in	Public	Act	No.	16-135.Werecommend	that	SB	178	conform	to	the	existing	statutory	definitionfor	EV	charging	technology.	The	Department	of	Energy	and	Environmental	Protection	and	Public	Utility	Regulatory	Authority	are	in	the	process	of	addressing	planning	and	strategy	for	transportation	electrification,	and	consistency	in	technological	definitions	will	support	the	achievement	of	Connecticut’s	electric	transportationgoals. Thank	you	for	your	consideration	on	these	matters.	Please	do	not	hesitate	to	reach	out	withany	questions. Sincerely, ExecutiveDirector,NortheastTechNet cfisher@technet.org508-397-4358
