It has come to my attention that this bill would promote a carbon tax. A tax again that would raise costs of vital services to Ct. residents. As a senior who has paid taxes all my adult life I am appalled that his administration continues to tax it's residents for every little thing. My Utilities in my home has gone up, my home taxes , my car taxes, my insurance on my home and car, my food costs , my registration of a motor vehicle all the while the $24 raise in SS hardly covers my expenses. If this government wants to secure more monies for budget and to run this state stop ridiculous spending and maybe take a look at young able bodied folks who receive a multitude of services from DSS. Low income housing., cell phones, food stamps,heating assistance, Medical and internet services.. These programs have become generational. Make it welfare to work nt welfare to next generation and the next.As a senior citizen I am tired of struggling while I see a young generation being compensated not to work. Mandate work programs for welfare and a welfare time limit and see the money will that flow into the budget. Then maybe taxpaying citizens would not have to carry the tax burden for services and monies utilized by non working, non taxpaying citizens. Look for solutions and budget cuts to these entitled program recipients rather than just propose a new tax on taxpaying Ct. citizens. Joanne Ouellette 1517 N. Colony Rd. Meriden, Ct. 06450
