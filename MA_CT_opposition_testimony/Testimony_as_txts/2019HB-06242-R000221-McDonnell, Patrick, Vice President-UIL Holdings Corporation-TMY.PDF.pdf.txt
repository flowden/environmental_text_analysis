WRITTEN TESTIMONY OF Patrick McDonnell UIL HOLDINGS CORPORATION (United Illuminating, Southern Connecticut Gas and Connecticut Natural Gas) Regarding Raised House Bill 6242 AN ACT PROHIBITING SURCHARGES FROM BEING LEVIED ON UTILITY CUSTOMERS TO SUBSIDIZE INTERSTATE NATURAL GAS PIPELINES Before the Energy & Technology Committee Legislative Office Building February 21, 2019 Good morning/afternoon Senators Needleman, Formica and Fonfara, Representatives Arconti, Ferraro and Allie-Brennan and the members of the Energy & Technology Committee. My name is Patrick McDonnell and I am the Vice President of Regulatory Affairs for UIL Holdings Corporation (UIL), the parent company for United Illuminating, Southern Connecticut Gas and Connecticut Natural Gas, and wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of Avangrid, Inc. I thank you for this opportunity to offer this testimony on behalf of SCG and CNG on Raised House Bill 6242, AN ACT PROHIBITING SURCHARGES FROM BEING LEVIED ON UTILITY CUSTOMERS TO SUBSIDIZE INTERSTATE NATURAL GAS PIPELINES. We are oppossed to House Bill 6242 because it will negatively impact our ability to provide our customers reliable natural gas service. All of the gas that we provide our customers to heat their homes is brought to us through interstate gas pipelines. We secure capacity on those interstate pipelines through long term contracts to insure our ability to provide natural gas to our customers during the coldest weather of the year. The cost of that pipeline capacity is included in the cost customers pay for their gas service. The language currently included in this bill would restrict our ability to recover those costs and negatively impact the reliable natural gas delivery that our customers have come to expect. For this reason we are opposed to House Bill 6242. Thank you. I would be happy to answer any questions at this time. You may also contact Al Carbone, Manager, AVANGRID/UIL State Government Relations at (203) 671-4421.
