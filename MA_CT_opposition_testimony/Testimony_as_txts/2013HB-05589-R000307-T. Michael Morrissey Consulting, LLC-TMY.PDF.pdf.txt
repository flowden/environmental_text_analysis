Written testimony of T. Michael Morrissey, Morrissey Consulting, LLC 332 Strickland ST, Glastonbury, CT 06033 860-280-8027 Morrissey.consulting@cox.net Energy & Technology Committee CT General Assembly March 7, 2013 Reference: Proposed H.B. No. 5589 AN ACT ESTABLISHING A PILOT PROGRAM FOR NATURAL GAS TRANSPORTATION. Good morning Senator Duff and Representative Reed and other distinguished members of your committee.  I am Mike Morrissey, from Glastonbury.  I am the Connecticut State Director to the National Propane Gas Association. Today, I represent the propane marketers of Connecticut who provide propane gas service to every community in our state.  I am here to comment on H.B. No. 5589 AN ACT ESTABLISHING A PILOT PROGRAM FOR NATURAL GAS TRANSPORTATION. The propane industry likes the concept of this bill and we encourage more bills that would stimulate the use of domestically produced alternative fuels to power municipal fleet vehicles. We would like to see the language of the bill expanded to include the use of propane. Propane, America’s other natural gas, is domestically produced and found in abundance in our country. Propane is currently powering over 18 million vehicles and is the leading alternate fuel worldwide and today is less than half the cost of gasoline and diesel fuel. Many municipalities in our state do not have natural gas available to them, expanding this bill to include propane, would give them an opportunity to develop a pilot program testing and evaluating the most popular alternative fuel in the world.  For those municipalities that have natural gas, including propane would allow for an opportunity to create some “head to head” competition for dueling “natural gases”.  A propane dispensing system can be built for a fraction of the cost of a natural gas fueling system and may make sense even when natural gas is available. Thank you and I am now available for your questions.
