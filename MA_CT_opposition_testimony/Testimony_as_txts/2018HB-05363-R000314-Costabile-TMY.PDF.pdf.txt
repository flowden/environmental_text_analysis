To Whom this Concerns: A Carbon TAX? Absolutely NOT! Connecticut residents can not afford any more taxes. I realize the State Pension Fund is well underfunded & at the current rate the situation is not sustainable, as are the give away programs such as Meals on Wheels, State Aid, Medicaid, Section Eight housing allowances, Social Security Disability, etc.; and let us not forget the total waste at institutions such as UCONN. It's time to stop the nonsense, eliminate fraud within these programs & control UCONN. Doesn't the legislators realize more taxes will drive more residents to the leave the State, especially Seniors with wealth in their retirement accounts to which they MUST take out their RMD @ 70 1/2 and pay taxes on it? The residents that will remain are those too elderly/not physically able to move, the young that have no RMD's to take out which translates into NO TAX & the Social Services recipients which most likely do not pay tax ( AND I KNOW A FEW OF THEM). If anyone is interested in what I learned during 40 +/-years of renting you only need to contact me. IMO, It's only time before the State of Connecticut & certain other States will file for reorganization under the Bankruptcy laws. The remaining questions are which State will be first & when will this occur? Rspectfully, Costabile Town of Oxford
