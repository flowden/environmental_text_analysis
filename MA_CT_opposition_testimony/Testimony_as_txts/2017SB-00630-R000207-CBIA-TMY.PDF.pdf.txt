Testimony of Eric Brown Senior Counsel Connecticut Business & Industry Association before the Energy and Technology Committee February 7, 2017 S.B. No. 630: An Act Concerning Clean and Renewable Energy Opportunities and Use of Renewable Energy Sources. CBIA opposes this proposal On behalf of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association (CBIA), thank you for the opportunity to testify on SB 630. Today, Connecticut faces many challenges as it struggles to compete in an increasingly competitive global marketplace. None stand out more prominently than our position as the least competitive state in New England, as well as the nation with respect to energy costs. Accordingly, our focus for this bill and others before you this session -and we hope increasingly for this committee and the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, will be whether the proposal before you is more likely or less likely to improve Connecticut's competitive standing with respect to the cost of energy. We believe S.B. 630 will place further upward pressure on energy costs in Connecticut by forcing energy suppliers to contract for larger quantities of more costly and less reliable renewable power. If the committee is willing to consider restructuring the RPS, including with respect to the types of eligible fuels, CBIA would be happy to part of that conversation. Short of that, we strongly oppose this measure for the reasons cited herein. Thank you very much for this opportunity to provide comment and your consideration or our position. Conn;:;clic.ut Bttsiw's& & lndudry As<;,ociotion 350 Chun:h Strt:et, Hartford, CT 06103-1126 ! 860.24 4.1900 I 660.278.8562 (f) I cbio.com !
