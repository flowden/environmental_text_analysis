TESTIMONY BEFORE THE ENERGY AND TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE LEGISLATIVE OFFICE BUILDING MARCH 5, 2020 My name is Shannon King, government affairs associate for CBIA, the Connecticut Business & Industry Association. CBIA is Connecticut’s largest business organization, with thousands of member companies, small and large, representing a diverse range of industries from across the state. Ninety-five percent of our member companies are small businesses, with less than 100 employees. CBIA offers the following testimony on HB 5350 An Act Concerning Natural Gas Infrastructure. CBIA supports Section 1, which authorizes DEEP to conduct request for proposals to purchase biogas generated from anaerobic digestion facilities, known as renewable natural gas. Expanding renewable energy sources such as biogas will help Connecticut achieve its carbon reduction goals. CBIA opposes Section 2(d), which limits the expansion of natural gas to businesses and residents. If implemented, this will make expanding gas access for businesses cost-prohibitive. Natural gas transmission continues to be a critical bridge fuel for meeting the state’s need for affordable, reliable energy for businesses and residents. Energy costs are one of the most important considerations for running a business in Connecticut. Our state has some of the highest energy costs in the nation—62% higher than the national average. Businesses of all sizes and industries need stability and predictability in managing operating costs. As this legislation develops, we urge the committee to recognize and consider the potential impact new energy and environmental policies have on ratepayers and ensure transparency around potential price increases on commercial and industrial, as well as residential, customers. We look forward to collaborating with the committee on this important legislation. Thank you for your time and the opportunity to testify.
