Dear Senators, I am an elected member of the Greenwich CT RTM. I have no connection to oil, gas, nor to any.related sectors. I have extensive engineering experience with 22 issued US Patents, and an MBA from Wharton. I fully support the effort to protect our environment from contaminated waste products, but SB 753 FAILS to do this and has unintended consequences. I believe SB 753 is needlessly broad and would have unintended consequences which will significantly hamper our state's economy (please also refer to the attached detail "How SB 753 Bans Steel and Fruit"): ¥ As drafted SB 753 prohibits common and perfectly safe "treated" products and byproducts a prevents recycling of Steel a prohibits the use of recycled asphalt, and concrete a bans fruit, vegetables, livestock and fish grown with recycled of water ¥ SB 753 is unscientific and fails to properly define oil and gas wastes and has many drafting errors a Improperly relies on the term "geologic or geophysical" which is normally used for exploration and not production a Improperly defines "waste" as "any liquid" a Does not distinguish harmful substances from safe ones -it's bad ifit touched an oil well a Provides no method for determining maximum acceptable levels a SB 753 language even covers refined petroleum products ¥ SB 753 prohibits the "sale" and "acquisition" of waste products and byproducts, even if they are not brought into the state interfering with interstate commerce I worked on a similar bill passed by the Greenwich RTM. After extensive discussion the Greenwich Ordinance was substantially revised and many exclusions were deemed necessary. I urge you to review and revise the language together with experts from EPA and DEEP. Most important: I urge you to modify SB 753 so that it does not hamper the normal recycling of steel, water, asphalt and concrete. Please do not be misled by Food & Water Watch and its local advocates: ¥ Lack of law suits at the local level to-date does not mean there are no problems Thank you for your time and consideration. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Respectfully, Michael Spilo Greenwich CT RTM DI I, Vice-Chair Public Works Committee Greenwich RTC, DI I Exec.
