Mainiero, Phil From:  Joe Catale <joe_catale@hotmail.com>  Sent:  Thursday, March 09, 2017 3:20 PM  To:  tratestimony  Subject:  HB-7097  I would like to voice my opposition to Bill HB 7097. As an employee of a dealership in Connecticut I cannot be but alarmed in what may be a very bleak future for myself, fellow employees and families. Such a bill if passed, would most certainly erode the jobs of many and only add to the issues that currently plague our state. Please do not allow this Bill to pass. Regards, Joe Catale 10 Cascio Road Ansonia, CT. 06401 Sent from Outlook 3
