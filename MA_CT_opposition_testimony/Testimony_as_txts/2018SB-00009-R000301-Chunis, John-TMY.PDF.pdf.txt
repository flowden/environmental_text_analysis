Senate Bill No. 9 "AN ACT CONCERNING CONNECTICUT'S ENERGY FUTURE" My Name is John Chunis and I live in Rocky Hill, Connecticut. Connecticut currently has one of the highest electricity rates in the country. The increased mandated renewable energy requirements specified in this bill will only make our energy costs higher. We also have one of the highest cost of living and highest taxes in the country. This is the main reason why companies and not starting up here and why existing companies and workers are leaving the state. We can no longer continue this trend and we should be taking steps to lower the cost of living and costs of doing business in this state. While environmental standards are a noble endeavor that we all should strive for, doing so with consequences that drives the state into bankruptcy would be foolhardy. I therefore OPPOSE this bill and ask that it NOT BE APPROVED. Thank you for allowing me to comment on this bill.
