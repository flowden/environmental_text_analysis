Northeast Utilities System TESTIMONY OF STEPHEN GIBELLI NORTHEAST UTILITIES ASSISTANT GENERAL COUNSEL ON BEHALF OF THE CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY Energy and Technology Committee March 4, 2014 RE: RAISED BILL 353, AN ACT CONCERNING THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLASS I RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCE PROJECTS This legislation expands upon the solicitation process first developed per Section 127 of Public Act 11-80 (now codified as Conn. Gen. Stat. § 16-244v).  The solicitations pursuant to that statute have been completed, but are essentially expanded upon through Sections 6 through 9 of Public Act 13-303. Public Act 13-303 allows for the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (“DEEP”) to direct the electric distribution companies (“EDCs”) to enter into contracts with enough renewable generators to assure that our RPS requirements are met. This legislation would simply add to the administrative burden of all parties directly involved in the solicitation process by requiring additional solicitations in parallel with those of Public Act 13-303. Also, any renewable projects contracting with the EDCs pursuant to this proposed legislation would likely reduce the amount entered into pursuant to Public Act 13-303 by a corresponding amount.  Hence, this legislation will likely not produce an increase the total amount of renewables under contract. Therefore, CL&P recommends that the solicitation process established through Public Act 13-303 be allowed to play out before additional (and potentially conflicting) solicitations be required. Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on this bill.
