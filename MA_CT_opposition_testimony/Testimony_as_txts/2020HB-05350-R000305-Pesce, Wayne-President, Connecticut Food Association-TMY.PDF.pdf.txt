No. 5350 AN ACT CONCERNING NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE. The Connecticut Food Association (CFA) proudly advocates on behalf of the food retail industry. Our mission is to promote the growth of Connecticut’s grocery retail community and its supplier network. We ask that you consider the following implications this legislation could have if passed: • Eliminates customers’ ability to choose how best to heat their homes/businesses; • Increases customers’ heating costs by prohibiting the most cost-effective heating option and forcing them to heat with electricity; • Does not achieve the desired carbon reductions because increased electricity will be required from the region’s natural gas-fired power plants; • Stifles economic development and job growth for businesses looking to locate or expand in Connecticut; • In communities that have yet to benefit from natural gas expansion, increases the energy cost to operate taxpayer-supported buildings like schools and libraries. H.B. 5350 would limit the length of time a natural gas utility has to recover its investments from natural gas expansion. As a result, it will make increasing the availability of natural gas to homes, businesses, and neighborhoods in Connecticut communities cost-prohibitive and will eliminate a reliable, efficient, and desired low-cost energy option. While we recognize that climate change and addressing the state’s energy challenges are of the utmost importance, this proposal as written would have a devastating impact on our business community, residents, and future economic growth. 433 South Main Street, Suite 309, West Hartford, CT 06110 email: ctfood@ctfoodassociation.org  · www.ctfoodassociation.org  · (860) 216-4055
