Dear State Personnel, I am a registered voter in CT and a resident for the last 50 years. I earned a B.A. at UCONN at Storrs and my M.A. working as a graduate assistant at WCSU. Later, I worked here to contribute towards Connecticut's economy. I also teach and tutor here, building up our youth. I serve in a local church, attend local events and sports, shops, grocery stores, and gas stations, etc. My husband and I have three children. My husband is an engineer. He has worked all his career in CT manufacturing, a dying business thanks to the way businesses are pushed out by --taxes, among other things. Our parents, siblings, nieces and nephews -here -in CT. Why would we consider leaving? Bill 5363 is among the reasons!!! Not only this, but the many, many taxes imposed by Malloy and our state house. Liberal spending, high taxation, no plan, no future -.CT. We vote and will not vote for a Democratic candidate in the upcoming elections. Where is the fiscal responsibility in CT? You are taxing us to death and into leaving our home of the last 50 years. Massachusetts and New Hampshire are looking very good. Say no to the Carbon TAX! Stop the tolls! Stop the mileage tax! Stop the tire tax! Stop the TAXES!!!!!!! You are killing this state. Annemarie Nakoneczny 231 Sprain Brook Rd. Woodbury, CT 06798 203-262-0248
