 for more than 40 years  has championed sence based solutions to the greatest challenges fang the ocean with the support and advocacy efforts of our members and conservation partners  has played a key leadership role in winning many victories on behalf of the ocean to te a few these victories include securing significant improvements to our nation’s fisheries management law while rebuilding vitally important fisheries establishing along the coast of california the nation’s only network of marine protected areas protecting the ocean’s vast array of wildlife—sea turtles whales dolphins and others—whose wellbeing has been jeopardized and habitats compromised hosting the largest global volunteer effort annually to rid the ocean and other waterways of dangerous and unsightly trash and leading the charge for comprehensive restoration in the gulf of mexico following the 2010 bp deepwater horizon oil disaster soon after taking the helm of the organization in february 2013 president and ceo andreas merkl kicked off a strategic effort to assess where we are now as an ocean conservation organization and where we should direct our efforts to achieve the most conservation impact going forward we looked at the major forces affecting ocean health ’s own history our strengths and passions and emerging issues— like climate change ocean adification and melting arctic wildlife habitats—that put enormous stress on the ocean and its preous resources our assessment revealed that our priorities are indeed the right ones first and foremost  is convinced that we can achieve the greatest conservation gains by approaching conservation holistically taking into account a region’s economic stability and human communities as well as its habitats wildlife and the range of stressors that harm ocean health we apply this ecosystem approach in the major places where we work and that our members love second  designs and implements sencebased solutions to overcome the myriad threats fang the ocean from increased adity levels caused by rising carbon dioxide levels to proliferation of marine debris that jeopardizes ocean life to the costly conflicts among ocean activities that result from the lack of smart planning for our ocean and coasts our future efforts like our current work will be grounded in these two priorities our research during this planning process also revealed that the enormous changes occurring in the ocean call for nimble adaptive solutions to meet the increasing challenges to ocean health and these changes are happening at the same time that technical analytical and sentific tools to aid conservation are becoming more widely available indeed this moment presents an opportunity—and a great deal of hope for ocean conservation—for  in collaboration with domestic and international partners to strengthen our conservation impact in the face of these changes and to accomplish those gains for the ocean we will need the help hard work and support of  members and allies we will proceed judiously in 2014 to incorporate new areas of work into our current conservation agenda for example we will expand our focus in the arctic from a solely us approach to one that extends across the arctic working to build an integrated approach to managing the ecosystems and activities in arctic seas with the opening of arctic waters and the increased shipping that accompanies melting ice—as well as the changes that follow the widening of the panama canal—we will focus on the shipping risks that arise for the ocean identifying the hot spots of risk from shipping and determining how best to mitigate them we will bring our decades of fisheries management experience to places beyond our national borders to address ecologically destructive overfishing and we will accelerate our analysis of plastic pollution which harms ocean wildlife and habitats with the goal of developing solutions to reduce it the confluence of a rapidly changing ocean and an explosion in demand for its natural resources espeally as the global population continues to increase mandates that  redouble our efforts new solutions are needed and we will work with colleagues and experts the world over to discover and implement them as  moves forward to embrace this exting future we are grateful for the continued support of our members who make our work possible we look forward to leading the way with you as our partners
