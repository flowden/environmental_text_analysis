 nearly 50 years ago an impressive group of highminded individuals gathered in europe to reflect on the vast imbalance between the wealth of available knowledge sence and conservation plans and the relative pauty of resources available to deliver against those intentions this group of sentists royals and philanthropists issued the morges manifesto a detailed analysis of the critical state of the world’s wildlife and a clarion call for the creation of an international organization to raise the funds necessary to save wildlife from extinction it stated all over the world today vast numbers of fine and harmless wild creatures are losing their lives or their homes in an orgy of thoughtless and needless destruction in the name of advanng vilization they are being shot or trapped out of existence on land taken to be exploited or drowned by new dams poisoned by toxic chemicals killed by poachers for game or butchered in the course of political upheaval  but although the eleventh hour has struck it is not too late to think again skilful sic and devoted men and admirable organisations are struggling to save the world’s wild life they have the ability and the will to do it but they tragically lack the support and resources just four months after this alarm sounded  was registered as a charity in switzerland and the international fundraising to deliver against urgent conservation needs offially began us was created later the same year on december 1 1961 in washington dc spees drove ’s creation and accordingly the organization grew by mounting campaigns to save them along the way we’ve learned that even though spees animate everything we do true success will come only if we grapple with the vast array of forces and pressures destroying spees and their habitats these two themes — spees and habitat conservation and threat reduction — serve as bookends for our work ’s mission directs us to work toward a future where “human needs are met in harmony with nature” but truthfully the rationale for our work lies in our own selfinterest protecting nature benefits us because of all that nature provides to enhance our lives — from stabilizing our climate to produng timber for our homes to providing seafood for the millions of people who depend on it as a key source of protein so while some would characterize the current state of the planet as a war of man versus nature the solution will ultimately be found in achieving the mutually reinforng balance articulated in our mission
