 i’ve often suggested that if we want to understand fully what lies at the heart of an organization we should be students of its history in particular we should closely examine the organization’s founding act―because more often than not the core dna of the institution is “baked in” at the moment of inception and of course at the heart of any such story one finds the organization’s founders whose personalities values and ambitions likely underpin much of what makes an organization tick to understand  one need look no further than our founder and chairman emeritus russell e train who passed away in september of 2012 russ broke with convention in most everything he did―with one exception throughout his career he hewed close to the conviction that lasting conservation utterly depends on nurturing the next generation of leaders as well as the capaty of organizations other than  under russ’s influence this nurturing process became part of ’s dna with support from a  grant in 1963 the african wildlife foundation awf―another organization russ founded―opened the college of african wildlife management in mweka tanzania the college has since trained more than 4000 park rangers and other wildlife managers from more than 50 countries in 1978  helped underwrite the cost of the rainbow warrior a boat launched from the london docks by greenpeace to protest commeral whaling the warrior went on to become the iconic image of a new chapter in conservation and in its third iteration still sails today  provided critical funding that helped launch ’s international program russ always believed we had more to gain than lose by supporting other likeminded organizations russ sat on ’s board of directors when we determined to create a local land trust to purchase grasslands in the northern great plains today american prairie reserve is a fundraising juggernaut on the way to assembling a 3 millionacre reserve in eastern montana and of course there are our alumni―people who have spent time at  and gone on to make a difference elsewhere but who carry “the panda” as part of their memory and dna russ train’s legacy lives on in the conservation heroes around the world whose training he made possible in the landscapes and creatures that thrive because of his devotion and in the countless individuals whose lives were made better simply by knowing him kathryn fuller served with distinction at  for over 25 years—17 as president―before leaving to among other things serve on many illustrious boards including as chair of the ford foundation and now the smithsonian’s

museum of natural history and recently became ceo of the wildlife conservation soety russ mittermeier was a researcher in colombia when he became head of ’s primate research unit he became our vice president for sence before leaving to become president of  a post he has held for the past 20 years but above all else russ train’s commitment to nurturing conservation leadership led to the creation of the russell e train education for nature efn program in 1994 since its inception efn has invested nearly 14 million to build conservation leadership in africa asia and latin america more than 1600 grants have been awarded worldwide supporting the educational pursuits of nearly 1200 conservation leaders from more than 50 countries the efn program has also helped hundreds of organizations conduct conservation skills workshops that have collectively trained more than 28000 people more than 90 percent of all train fellows return home after completing their degree and more than 40 percent of efn’s grantees are women―espeally significant for a program that aims to level the conservation playing field efn’s legacy includes radha wagle the first female conservation officer at nepal’s department of national parks and wildlife conservation margarita hurtado creator of an environmental education program used by 2800 students at 70 high schools across mexico and dr somchanh bounphanmy who started the first and only biology graduate program in laos these women were able to achieve things that would have been unimaginable even 20 years ago their success reflects russ’s belief in the power of people to achieve extraordinary things that will live on beyond the walls of  and make a lasting contribution to the greater good upon russ’s passing we determined to honor his legacy by expanding the education for nature program our goal is to double the number of scholarships the program can offer and to do so by raising funds in russ’s memory over the long run we plan to build a strong online conservation curriculum so that hundreds of thousands of people around the world can learn the best available approaches to sence ecoregional planning communitybased natural resource management policy initiatives and more this work is not about the perpetuation of  it is about the perpetuation of nature upon which our lives―and the lives of all other living things― depend and so it is fundamental for us to continue building the capaty of others to do this work over the very long run for many of us russ train will always represent the heart and soul of  his legacy lives on in the conservation heroes around the world whose training he made possible in the landscapes and creatures that thrive because of his devotion and in the countless individuals whose lives were made better simply by knowing him and as i reminded our staff during a ceremony to remember russ this winter it is only right that we honor his memory by maintaining the spirit of his work―by keeping the courage of our convictions by scrupulously avoiding convention by tending relationships with friend and foe and by cultivating the next generation of leaders to whom his torch has been passed
