 if you still need convinng about the realities of global warming look no further arctic temperatures are already 2°c above the 20th century average and warming at twice the global rate for every 1°c rise the region’s yearround ice shield diminishes by a breathtaking 150 million hectares it is likely that summer sea ice will be entirely gone within the next several years climate change in the far north of our planet is a disproportionately serious matter the arctic region has a profound effect on worldwide weather patterns sea levels and climate change as ice melts and glaerfed rivers increase their flow oceans elsewhere become less salty and their levels rise – by as much as 1020cm over the last century at the heart of the problem is a phenomenon known as the “albedo effect” ice naturally reflects sunlight back into space the less ice there is the less this happens and the more sunlight is absorbed by darker land masses these masses warm which reduces the possibilities of new ice forming – a climatedamaging spiral with many consequences melting permafrost releases trapped methane – a serious greenhouse gas warming peat deposits and increased soil respiration release further carbon into the atmosphere but the most serious risks are posed by ice melt largescale reduction of the greenland icecap would raise sea levels around the world suffiently to flood hundreds of coastal ties and threaten millions of lives in dense lowlying countries such as bangladesh fresh water is less dense than seawater so large volumes of snowmelt in the oceans stay at the surface blocking the natural oxygen intake of the salt water layers below and creating biological dead zones they can also interfere with the established patterns of ocean currents – with potentially catastrophic effects diversion of the gulf stream for example could plunge northwestern europe into nearpermanent winter not least arctic climate change means loss of habitat for countless seabirds seals and polar bears and threatens the sustainability of the region’s four major ocean fisheries the future of the arctic hangs in delicate balance – an environmental tipping point of immeasurable consequences for the planet if we are to save this region we must succeed in curbing climate change we must also manage it in ways that ensure its resilience to changes that are already inevitable ’s arctic vision a new approach to managing the arctic – key regulator of the global climate system the underlying vision of our arctic project is to protect and preserve this valuable wilderness – for its own sake and for the sake of the rest of the world it seeks to highlight the dangers of further destabilizing fragile ecosystems to inspire global action on climate change and to secure international management of the region to protect its resilience
