 at the core of the conservation movement is a profound belief in the value of nature from the economic to the aesthetic to the restorative and spiritual nature’s value reveals itself in many ways and all are integral to ’s work the economic value of nature particularly must be considered in nearly everything we do—from trying to reduce pollution in the atmosphere to restoring degraded lands to combating wildlife crime we also work hard to ensure that nature’s value influences the biggest desions made by soety for example guiding a company that harvests timber to modify its plans in order to conserve forests save endangered spees or maximize the sequestration of carbon in the trees with a global population of more than 7 billion the human forces of consumption and resource utilization will overwhelm the natural world if we don’t incorporate the economic value of nature into our desionmaking processes at  we are heavily invested in the natural capital project a sencebased partnership with stanford university the university of minnesota and  to develop tools to quantify the economic value of various natural resources and ecological processes—such as water filtration the regulation of climate and crop pollination making sure these tools are used by governments and companies is one of our most important objectives but of course nature’s value goes far beyond economics or markets or pring schemes the value of nature is in the glory of the bird’s song and the sweep of land a family has called home for generations and the sacred legends of forests or animals that are the heart and soul of a community they must be accounted for as well so we take speal measures to save those things that are outside the traditional economy we work to establish protected terrestrial and marine areas that might not have remarkable value in terms of market economics but whose conservation is nonetheless critical to the health of natural ecosystems and the survival of spees we help governments design infrastructure that is considerate of its impact on natural surroundings and we work to ensure that communities can uphold their sacred traditions without compromising alreadyreduced populations of tigers elephants and rhinos establishing the value of nature is important work our task is challenging and the results will not be immediate ultimately though the fate of the planet and of the quality of individual lives depends on our success and so  is committed to meeting this challenge through sencebased innovation broadbased outreach and the support of our friends and partners if we value what nature gives us—clean air and water food livelihoods health comfort—we must work tirelessly for its conservation
