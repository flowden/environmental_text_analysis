 late last winter when us offials began advising handwashing and issuing stay athome orders in response to an unprecedented public health emergency they likely werent picturing the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who lacked running water or struggled to keep the lights on these affordability issues were already simmering in the background  and then covlo hit says mae wu who advocated for access to safe and affordable drinking water at  for 14 years against a background of staggering unemployment rates the risk of mass utility shutoffs has skyrocketedjust as residents need these basic services the most to protect public health  has been urging governors utilities and congress to ban utility disconnections by midmay after the pandemics first wave 15 states plus the district of columbia and puerto rico established shortterm moratoriums on water shutoffs thanks in part to petitions from more than 17000  members several governors required safe reconnections for all occupied homes and offered emergency water in the interim numerous public and private electrity providers also responded to these calls for preventing service disconnections during the crisis but the successes were only short term many state shutoff moratoriums expired and by the end of november only 45 percent of americans were protected from disconnections of their electrity and gas service far fewer were protected from statewide water shutoffs which has left hundreds of millions of americans at risk in the face of this ongoing crisis  continues to fight for longâ€¢term investments in both repairing our national water infrastructure and upgrading homes particularly for those who bear the largest energy burdens that includes residents of the countrys 10 million affordable multifamily units almost half of which were built at least 5o years ago many are in desperate need of retrofits to drafty windows ineffient lighting and outmoded heating and ac systems and aging appliances such as refrigerators such improvements not only lower bills but they can also reduce greenhouse gases and benefit indoor air quality to date the program has helped more than 200000 renters across the country the impact is substantial says s deron lovaas who works with the energy effiency for all project low income people pay a big chunk of their household budgets on energy bills so its like a regressive tax the pandemic has reinforced the importance of finding ways to help make these basic costs of living manageable and boosting the resillience of homes to economic shocks over the longterm in few us ties is the burden of high utility bills more apparent than in detroit since 2014 some 140000 of its residents have faced water shutoffs due to skyrocketing water rates a 35 percent poverty rate and what the aclu dubbed floppy billing practices by the detroit water and sewerage department though covid19 has brought this crisis to a head  has been working with the local peoples water board coalition since 2017 to champion solutions such as incomebased water rates more sustainable payment plans or a redistribution of infrastructure costs to the wealthier detroit suburbs the public health risks of utility shutoffs are grave and the impacts trickle down to mental health as well nicole hill a detroit resident and longtime advocate for affordable water described the trauma at a press conference hosted by the peoples water board coalition living with the fear of losing your children to child protective services or the stigma and stereotypes of the supposed spending habits or never knowing the rcumstances accounting for why my water bills are so high is very frustrating she said activists like hill have long worked to highlight the link between public health and the lack of running water says cyndi roper an nroc policy expert whos worked on drinking water issues in the great lakes state for 25 years it took a global pandemic for the obvious to become front and center in michigan thanks to the dogged advocacy of the peoples water board coalition and its allies including  last march governor gretchen whitmer ensured reconnections for all occupied homes no matter how long theyd been disconnected whitmer also ordered the distribution of emergency bottled water supplies for cooking and drinking and dedicated 2 million for reconnections that will require plumbing repairs in order to make the tap water safe again but by october the michigan supreme court had invalidated the governors executive order working together with local grassroots leaders  kept up its fight for the most vulnerable michiganders by supporting critical state legislation that placed a moratorium on water shutoffs and required water reconnections for an occupied homes until spring 2021 data compiled by  in collaboration with the peoples water board coalition is credited with garnering bipartisan support for the bill signed into law in december further relief came after detroits mayor mike duggan announced a two year pause on water shutoffs and a commitment to finding a permanent solution as roper notes advocacy remains critical to reminding those in power of the injustices that so many people endure and the imperative to make change there is really a heightened sense of awareness that there are people living in michigan without running water roper says because there has been coverage of the issue in a way that has never been done before
