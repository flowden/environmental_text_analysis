 it wasn’t until i moved to latin america and the united states that i saw that there is a big role to play for the private sector and vil soety i went to college in arizona where a guest lecturer talked about conservation in baja california mexico his organization had fought the expansion of a salt mine that would have impacted some of the most important gray whale breeding habitat in the world he shared how vil soety and the tourism sector came together and managed to stop the mine i thought it was a great story and i approached him afterward to learn more about the group he worked for it was —where i soon started working as an intern and never left that was almost 20 years ago europe is an outsized player in the global conservation agenda europe is central to sustainable development and climate policy and is the largest contributor of climate finance to developing countries and the world’s biggest aid donor european businesses lead on progressive environmental issues europe is where some of our most transformational actions can take place since 2008 we have already raised 147 million in european public funding for conservation mostly from germany and norway and in just a couple years we’ve raised 3 million in private philanthropy now we’re also beginning to do project work in europe but with a different business model for example the balkans home to much of europe’s remaining wilderness and biodiversity is a region targeted for a boom in hydropower development we have an opportunity to engage with desionmakers who will determine how and where future dams are built and to make an enormous positive impact on the health of rivers using sence as a guide joining forces with finanal institutions and local ngos we can move the hydropower industry toward more sustainable dam planning siting and design the balkans is a perfect demonstration site we’ve also been asked by partners in germany the netherlands and the uk to lend our 15 years of oyster reef restoration expertise i think that over the next five years you’ll see more such projects in europe—always done with others and serving local and our global goals at the same time after more than 15 years in the us latin america and the caribbean i’m back in europe while my heart beats for the fjords and mountains of scandinavia my job is best done from europe’s capitals it’s in berlin london oslo and brussels where we can influence policy transform industries and mobilize funding for our conservation priorities including the gray whale habitats in baja
