 duncan marsh is the director of international climate policy for the conservancy and leads our initiative to reduce emissions from tropical deforestation by catalyzing a global market that values carbon stored in standing forests “deforestation accounts for approximately 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and is one of the leading sources of emissions from many developing countries nevertheless the destruction of the world’s remaining tropical forests continues at alarming rates if deforestation is 20 percent of the problem redung emissions by conserving forests can be 20 percent of the solution to climate change while also preserving biodi versity and promoting sustainable livelihoods “by seeking to establish an economic value for the carbon in standing forests we are providing an alternative to the economic forces that lead to the destruction of forests we want to match up global demand for reduced emissions of carbon with the ability of forests particularly tropical forests to store carbon very effectively the con servancy’s ontheground forest carbon projects in places like the noel kempff mercado climate action project in bolivia keep millions of tons of potential carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere “i’m encouraged by the fact that the international community led by key developing countries is beginning to recognize that forest conservation has an important role to play in efforts to mitigate climate change the question is whether we can put in place the necessary incentive structures in time to save the remaining tropical forests and avoid the more serious impacts of climate change the conservancy is at the vanguard of that movement”
