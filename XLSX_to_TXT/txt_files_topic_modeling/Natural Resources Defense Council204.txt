  is integrating its expertise in pollution prevention water effiency and climate change to sustain america’s preous water resources in addition to continued defense of the clean water act and prosecution of polluters we will add new focus on solutions that are practical and that can have transformative impacts espeally the use of green infrastructure not only does green infrastructure—such as pocket parks and green areas to channel runoff— dramatically reduce stormwater pollution and create new water sources in arid landscapes but it has also been shown to generate more longterm job opportunities for local workers decades of unsustainable development have wrapped our ties and towns in a concrete cocoon of roads parking lots and sidewalks when rain falls on these impermeable surfaces it has nowhere to go but downhill picking up everything in its path—from motor oil and road salt to litter and pestides meanwhile steady rains can overwhelm falities designed to treat a mixture of stormwater and sewage pouring toxic waste into rivers lakes or coastal waters as a result urban runoff is a leading cause of water pollution in the united states to stem this threat  is working closely with ties and states from coast to coast to expand their use of green infrastructure these lowimpact inexpensive solutions—including pocket parks green roofs sterns permeable pavement and other techniques—retain and filter rainwater where it falls rather than dumping it into waterways or sewage treatment systems every five years states counties and large ties are required to update a clean water act permit for operating their munipal stormsewer systems as these runoff control plans are reissued  is working to establish enforceable green infrastructure requirements in every stormwater permit for development and redevelopment including road retrofit and renovation projects in america’s 10 largest urban areas on the west coast we scored two major victories in 2010 when we persuaded regional water boards in the san fransco bay area and in several counties in southern california—two of the nation’s most populated regions—to adopt strict plans for controlling urban runoff across the country in west virginia we worked with the environmental protection agency to craft a similar plan for the entire state and defended it in court meanwhile we are advanng green infrastructure as a costeffective solution to sewer overflow problems in ties such as philadelphia which has proposed a groundbreaking 20year plan for more than 1 billion in green infrastructure investments in new york ty we are promoting a similar approach to address the ty’s 27billion gallonperyear sewage overflow problem at the federal level we are building support in congress for a bill that would make green infrastructure and lowimpact development techniques a national priority if adopted the legislation will establish institutional research centers for green infrastructure as well as require the environmental protection agency to incorporate green infrastructure prinples more broadly into its permitting and other programs most important the bill will provide communities with the finanal and technical resources they need to implement green infrastructure projects on the ground we are also advanng separate legislation that would authorize billions of dollars worth of critical assistance for various waterquality improvement projects including the use of green infrastructure
