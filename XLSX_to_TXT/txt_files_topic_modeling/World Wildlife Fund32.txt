 in 2001  celebrated its 40th anniversary and looked back at an impressive record of conservation work in that time  carried out many thousands of field projects mainly in developing countries and often in partnership with other agenes thus directly contributing to sustainable development and poverty alleviation over those 40 years  also increasingly contributed to global environmental policy development and played the key role in introdung market mechanisms such as the forest stewardship counl fsc which today allows business and industry to engage in environmentally sound practices looking ahead to the next 40 years this first year into the new century has marked huge emerging challenges in our fight for life on earth never before in the history of the environmental movement have the stakes been higher neither has awareness been more widespread that global environmental issues will soon determine the fate of virtually every sector of human activity and welfare without wanting to sound alarmist there can be little doubt that very large parts of humanity will suffer from a worsening global water crisis and the disastrous effects of the rampant mismanagement of the world’s marine resources according to ’s living planet report we have lost onethird of the planet’s natural wealth over the last 30 years a trend unlikely to improve in the near future given the increasing “footprint” that mankind leaves on the earth – now visible even in the remotest wilderness areas the arctic while not having the high profile of tropical rainforests or coral reefs is neverthe less a prime example of how the quest for resources – above all petroleum – is rapidly pushing into areas hitherto left to the few indigenous communities polar bears and caribou herds exploitation of the arctic by extractive industries brings high risks with effects that are likely to be dramatic for both nature and the cultures of peoples who have made their livelihood in a perfectly sustainable manner for many hundreds of years climate breakthrough perhaps the most remarkable development of the past year has been the widespread acceptance at last of manmade climate change as the global issue that is likely to impact virtually every aspect of biodiversity conservation and human life in the years ahead the long lag time between the emission of greenhouse gases and the actual effects of climate change means there can be no question that the coming decades will seriously erode the planet’s biodiversity making deep inroads into the natural inheritance of future generations the third assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ippc left no doubt over the fact that these impacts are already evident melting polar ice increased forest fires changing distribution patterns of plants and animals increasing indence of coral bleaching deser tification and extreme and destructive weather events are just some of the telltale signs  has been campaigning for six years for governments and industry to take action to combat climate change our analyses and warnings have been ignored critized even ridiculed for a large part of this time the major breakthrough in public consousness came in july 2001 with the global community’s acceptance of the kyoto protocol despite the us government opting out of the agreement president bush’s provocative and intrinsically unwise desion however had a positive sideeffect it elevated the issue of climate change into the headlines this inadvertently helped unify the stance of other governments not least the europeans in at last taking the issue more seriously the emerging clarity over the root causes of biodiversity loss and the ecological footprint that limits the potential for sustainable development also triggered a further focusing of  ’s activities in the past year  has concluded its networkwide exerse to con centrate its efforts for maximum impact on the one hand we will work on six global issues forests fresh water oceans and coasts threatened spees climate change and toxics – for each of which we have clear targets and strategies and on the other hand our fieldbased activities will increasingly be focused on ecoregions – biogeographic units that allow a coherent planning and approach for the conservation of biodiversity i am convinced that this twopronged strategy – focusing on global policy and ecoregions – puts  in the best pos sible position to make a real difference in addressing the huge conservation challenges of the coming decades we need your support to make it a reality
