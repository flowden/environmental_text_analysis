 at sundown the 45foot avenger a commeral fishing vessel rolls gently as crew members bait hooks 80 miles off galveston texas “i’ve been slammin’ fish on and off for ten years” says frank a wiry deckhand with a sprawling treasure map tattoo “it’s tough work but you can make good money” the bounty has been good recently thanks to a management program  helped implement for gulf red snapper in 2007 a decade ago this fishery was on the brink of collapse with fish stocks plummeting regulators cut the season to a few days per month often in winter when the gulf was at its roughest the shortened seasons hurt fishermen finanally and gave rise to dangerous “derbies” in which the fishing boats raced into storms and the restrictions didn’t solve the overfishing problem the short windows also meant too many fish were brought to market at the same time creating a glut that crashed prices “my life was a disaster” recalls captain buddy guindon “during the derbies i didn’t go to my kid’s baseball games i didn’t go to church i didn’t do all the things normal people do”  proposed a different approach called catch shares under catch shares sentists determine the total allowable annual catch for a fishery and fishermen are assigned a percentage of it based on their catch history now fishermen have a stake in the fishery’s recovery as populations rebound so does their catch we brought fishermen to washington to build support and helped design a catch share program that was approved overwhelmingly “we’re catching bigger fish” says guindon “our prices at the dock have increased and our costs have gone down” the program has also helped end overfishing and restore balance to the ecosystem the gulf red snapper population has improved enough to warrant a 70 increase in the allowable catch since 2008 the recovery was so remarkable that in 2013 the monterey bay aquarium took red snapper off the “avoid” list in its seafood guide for the consumer this means sustainably caught red snapper all year long “catch shares simply couple responsibilities and rewards” says our oceans vp amanda leland “fishermen are safer fishing is more profitable and the oceans are more abundant” the success in the gulf has contributed to the creation of catch share programs for the pafic coast and new england all told 65 of fish landed by commeral fishermen in us federal waters are now under catch shares management up from 10 when we started catch shares work in 1996 “before catch shares my sons didn’t have a future as commeral fishermen” says guindon “now they do”
