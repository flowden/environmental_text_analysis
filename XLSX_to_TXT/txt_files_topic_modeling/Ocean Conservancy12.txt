 building on our 2017 report restoring the gulf beyond the shore — part ii this year we advocated for five restoration solutions that would help the gulf’s fish and corals bounce back from the bp oil disaster with projects that include working cooperatively with sentists to restore reef fish habitats to longterm monitoring of our varied coral reef habitats across the gulf we hope to see these project ideas included in the deepwater horizon trustees’ open ocean restoration plan expected in early 2019 this plan will be the first payment of the 1 billion to restore the gulf’s marine wildlife and habitats earmarked within the 20 billion bp settlement this year we have also been tracking the trump administration’s proposed plan to open all us waters to oil and gas activities and opposing their efforts to put oil and gas companies ahead of coastal communities
