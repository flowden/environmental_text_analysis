 inspired by a conversation between  board member william “beau” wrigley jr and dr greg stone executive vice president of ’s betty and gordon moore center for sence and oceans the ocean heath index was developed as an important tool to guide nations businesses and policymakers that are responsible for managing ocean resources as greg recalls “beau is a successful businessman he pointed out that really the oceans are an asset in business you always track whether your assets are increasing or decreasing why haven’t we figured out a way to do that for the ocean” to begin greg reached out to two respected colleagues dr steve katona who was at the college of the atlantic performing innovative studies in ocean health and ecosystem management and dr ben halpern of the national center for ecological analysis and synthesis at the university of santa barbara who had recently published groundbreaking research about human pressures on ocean resources together they assembled a prestigious team representing the top institutions—including the university of british columbia’s sea around us project the national geographic soety the new england aquarium and more than 65 sentists from around the world—to tackle the considerable challenge of developing a new way to measure ocean health from the beginning the ocean health index team was committed to challenging the lens through which ocean ecosystems are typically viewed “what we realized in working together is that people and the ocean are no longer separate people have to be included in the ocean ecosystem” says steve katona who joined  as managing director for the ocean health index “humans are part of everything now and if you could find ways to improve the benefits obtained from the seas and reduce the impact people have the benefits flowing from the ocean would be much greater for people” after four years the team’s work culminated in the 2012 release of the ocean health index the firstever world standard for gauging ocean health by calculating sustainable use of marine resources— giving the world and each country with a coastline hard numbers showing how each is performing information including the details behind each score is publicly accessible and free through the index website wwwoceanhealthindexorg the index defines a healthy ocean as one that delivers a range of key ecological soal and economic benefits to people these benefits range from food provision to tourism and recreation biodiversity carbon storage and more ocean conditions have never been assessed from so many different and important perspectives in 2013 the ocean health index global score was 65 out of 100 derived by averaging scores of the 151 coastal and island countries that are calculated annually these scores provide useful information by identifying overexploited resources—as well as missed opportunities to maximize sustainable use of the ocean and the index is getting attention after a colombian newspaper reported the country’s score in 2012 colombian offials wanted to collaborate with  to learn more the index’s framework resonated with colombian policymakers as a result colombia launched an agenda azul or “blue agenda” that contributes to ocean health while supporting jobs food production clean water carbon storage and biodiversity in june 2013 the ocean health index’s first international training session took place in santa barbara with partipants representing colombia china israel philippines and hawai‘i in 2013 the world economic forum endorsed the index as the first comprehensive measure of how sustainably we are using the ocean and the team continues to refine methodologies and engage desionmakers in the process “we want to support nations as they build healthy green and blue economies that thrive well into the future” greg stone says “if the world unites behind a common metric the cumulative benefits of each desion and action will become global imagine what could happen if we all take aim at the same target”
