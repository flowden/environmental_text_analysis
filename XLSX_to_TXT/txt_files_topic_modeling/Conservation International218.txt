 to prevent a climate catastrophe there are certain places on earth that must be protected above all else according to research by  sentists why because of the climatewarming carbon that these ecosystems store a team of researchers determined how much carbon is stored in nature around the world and measured how long it would take to get it back if it is lost — and what that loss would mean for humanity with these criteria the researchers were able to pinpoint which ecosystems are most crual to prioritize for climate action — and where humans can actually have an impact all told the amount of “irrecoverable carbon” stored in these ecosystems is equivalent to decades of fossil fuel emissions at current rates  is now using this research to undertake an ambitious initiative to protect tens of thousands of square miles of natural areas working with the private sector communities and governments to make conservation of these areas a priority
