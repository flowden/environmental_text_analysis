  helps secure historic treaty to limit bottomtrawling fishing in the 1990s sentists conducting deepsea dives discovered mount ing evidence that the world’s high seas—a loosely regulated expanse of international waters spanning half of the earth’s surface—are home to a vast array of previously undiscovered marine spees the divers witnessed something else too massive areas of the ocean floor the lifeblood of our deepseas realm had been scraped clean by a form of industrial fishing called bottom trawling bottomtrawling boats use weighted nets up to 200 feet long and 40 feet wide to go as far as 6000 feet below the ocean’s surface with a single pass these nets wipe out everything in their path from centuriesold coral forests to delicate sponge fields shocked by the sentists’ reports  set out to sound the alarm in the world’s ultimate rulemaking forum the un general assembly in 2011 following five years of steady pressure and rigorous oversight by  and our partners the world’s leading fishing nations signed a landmark treaty to protect more than 16 million square miles of the pafic ocean from unregulated destructive bottom trawling we began laying the groundwork for this historic victory back in 2006 when armed with the best available sentific evidence we helped convince the un to pass a resolution calling on fishing nations to stop unregulated bottom trawling for the first time the resolution restricted countries from authorizing bottomtrawling expeditions without first examining the impacts of this activity on corals and other ecological treasures and then adopting measures to prevent those impacts with this key milestone in place we began the painstaking process of drawing up a treaty ensuring that fishing nations lived up to their commitments as a member of the us delegation ’s international oceans program director lisa speer reviewed and commented on reams of government documents and enlisted the world’s leading sentists to help at crual moments given the mix of countries involved—canada japan russia china korea and taiwan—a strong us position was essential to achieve this we worked closely with the state department and other conservation groups to highlight the impacts of highseas bottom trawling on us fisheries and other domestic interests gradually a strongly worded treaty began to take shape finalized in february the treaty prohibits any new bottom trawling unless its impacts on corals and deep sea fish are considered and controlled the agreement also creates the north pafic fisheries commission which is charged with implementing and enforng these restrictions in the coming months and years we will continue to work with our partners to win stricter requirements for assessing monitoring and controlling the impacts of bottom trawling and to extend protections to unregulated areas in the southern reaches of the north pafic in the meantime this hardwon treaty is an important step toward ensuring that the mysteries of the sea amaze and inspire future generations
