 “no environmental legislation has ever been passed without bipartisan support so it’s critical to depolarize environmental issues” says environmental defense action fund president elizabeth thompson “that’s why we engage with the political system in a nonpartisan way”  has long been an influential voice in washington when the need to represent environmental issues in congress began to exceed the 1 million annual cap on our lobbying costs set by tax law we created the environmental defense action fund a sister group that is free of such limits because it accepts only nondeductible donations gifts to the action fund allow us to target key legislators and mount ad campaigns that identify legislation by name more than 500000 of our members have signed up to contact their representatives in congress before important votes one example of bipartisan cooperation was passage of the restore act in 2012 directing large portions of bp’s oil spill fines to gulf coast restoration businesspeople sentists and others helped us persuade congress and the action fund paid for an ad blitz to sway wavering lawmakers restore passed 373–52 in the house and 74–19 in the senate this year the first funds—125 billion—flowed to the largest ecosystem restoration in us history to help deliver ’s message we have assembled a network of influential supporters our strategic partners these allies including local and national vic and religious leaders economists and ceos contact legislators personally and explain our solutions calls and emails from action fund members turn up the pressure “we can’t match the lobbyists dollar for dollar” says thompson “but lawmakers listen to their supporters and many supporters in both parties care about the environment so what we ask them to do is to speak up about it and we help amplify their voices”
