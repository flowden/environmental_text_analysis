 water is as essential as the air we breathe without it there is no life yet although more than 70 per cent of our blue planet is covered by water less than 3 per cent of it is fresh water and much of that is locked up in glaers snowcaps and permafrost leaving only a tiny fraction suitable and available for human use – for drinking sanitation hydroelectrity industry inland transport fishing and growing crops of these agriculture uses by far the most – almost twothirds with a quarter of the population fang a shortage the world is already experienng a severe and growing water crisis that is mirrored by the steep decline in freshwater ecosystems clearly something has to be done and one of the first steps is to curb agriculture’s thirst for water quenching “thirsty” crops in the past two years  has worked closely with leading multinational companies ngos and research institutes to change the way that thirsty crops espeally cotton rice and sugar are grown the aim is to introduce better farming practices that reduce the environmental and soal impacts of cultivation while also increasing farm income more cotton for less  it is ironic that cotton a crop that needs a lot of water is mostly grown in hot semiarid countries where water is at a premium one such country is pakistan where  has an ongoing programme to encourage farmers to conserve water by adopting “bed and furrow” irrigation in combination with integrated pest management techniques results of these efforts over the last five years demonstrate that more cotton can be grown using up to 30 per cent less water up to 25 per cent less chemical fertilizer and less than half the pestide – while putting more money into farmers’ pockets this not only reduces the crop’s dependence on water but also helps stabilize the surrounding ecosystem by maintaining the area’s natural flows benefiting spees like the indus river dolphin similar results can be gained when other major crops such as sugar cane and wheat are raised using improved crop practices managing water for people and nature each year the maraserengeti region in africa experiences one of nature’s grandest spectacles in april and may more than 1 million wildebeest over 200000 zebras and about 400000 thomson gazelles migrate westward from the ndutu plain of tanzania in search of food and the region’s most fragile resource water one of the few reliable sources they find is the mara river the only perennial river in the region in recent years however the mara has been subject to increasing demands from agriculture mining industries and a growing human population as well as deforestation in its headwaters significant reduction in flow and quality are already evident espeally during the dry season glows to the rescue to counter the problem  is working with the norwegian agency for development cooperation norad and the global water for sustainability glows programme a consortium led by the florida international university and backed by the us agency for international development to help local communities around the masai mara and serengeti reserves in kenya and tanzania to set up systems for monitoring water quality and quantity and develop ways to finance sustainable river conservation for both people and nature similar glows integrated water resourcemanagement initiatives are under way in latin america and india with more to follow in coming years
