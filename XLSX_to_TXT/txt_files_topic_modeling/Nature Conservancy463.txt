 bill mcdonald and humberto de hoyos cattle ranchers and conservationists who are working to protect grasslands canyons and mountains of the north american west our lasting impression the beauty of the usmexico borderlands expansive grasslands and the pervasive smell of the pines what we want to contribute preserving a way of life that has supported our families for generations when it comes to nature there are certain things you don’t have to tell ranchers such as bill mcdonald and humberto de hoyos one is that now and forever the land matters “anyone whose grandfather earned a living off this tough but generous countryside knows that if the land fails so does the rancher” says de hoyos another is that cattle—like fire rain and even prairie dogs—are a force of nature linked to the land on which they depend these things mcdonald and de hoyos know from loving working and protecting the land that sustained their fathers’ fathers and they are sharing these insights through a partnership that puts ranchers conservationists and policymakers on the same powerful team in 1991 mcdonald whose family has raised livestock in arizona’s pelonllo mountains for five generations began meeting with other local ranchers to address a shared challenge the economic hardships of ranching meant that in order to survive more families might have to subdivide their land for sale to developers and in a community of rugged individualists who understand the bottom line no one wanted to see that happen ranchers and conservationists the ranchers soon found that their vision of seamless sound borderlands was compatible with the aims of unlikely allies conservationists looking to save one of north america’s last great places in 1993  offered its support to what would become the malpai borderlands group a ninemember nonprofit named for the ranch where members held their first meetings today the million acres that constitute the malpai borderlands include the magnificent gray ranch in new mexico a former conservancy project and one of the richest natural habitats in the united states what began as a conversation between likeminded ranchers and sentists has grown into a major conservation force generating innovative solutions that combine sence with old fashioned collaboration permanent easements protect malpai members’ land from subdivision and ensure habitat for wildlife a “grassbank” enables ranchers to graze their herds while their own land depleted by drought rests and replenishes itself malpai also is conducting experiments that explore ageold ranching questions are cattle a blight upon the land or like the bison before them a contributor to grassland renewal can fire prevent mesquite and other heavy shrub growth from overtaking natural grasses and can cattle and prairie dogs living symbiotically help keep pastures healthy crossing into mexico the conversation begun at malpai has grown to include voices from across the border such as that of de hoyos whose family has worked a ranch near cananea mexico for three generations through “ranching today” seminars held in cooperation with the conservancy malpai members share what they have learned about the complex balance between progress and overdevelopment working the land and protecting it mexican ranchers like de hoyos learn how their north borderlands counterparts are addressing development and conservation issues that could sweep into mexico with their enlightened attitudes ranching traditions and pragmatic backgrounds mcdonald and de hoyos represent a generation working to demonstrate that cattle and conservation are not mutually exclusive propositions mcdonald a macarthur foundation award repient with a political sence degree uses his negotiating skills to steer malpai members toward informed consensus meanwhile de hoyos—a former professional basketball player and vil engineer entrepreneur and local history buff—is developing his ranch to sustain both cattle and conservation he is building a haenda where guests will be able to experience the magical blend of lifestyle and land that keep him tied to ranching perhaps mcdonald speaks for other ranchers when he sums up what collaboration has brought to the borderlands paradise they’re working to preserve “i used to feel it was inevitable that vilization would overtake the ranch that the roads would be paved that stores would spring up” he says “now i have hope that there will always be wideopen spaces where people can live intelligently off the land they love”
