 in this political climate it’s increasingly hard to make people tune into the issues we find so critical how does the partner ships team help ensure our messages will break through pop culture and entertainment are one way of getting that attention espeally when we’re trying to attract young people to the issues but we’re also trying to broaden our audience and create more diversity in the environmental movement in general so when choosing celebrities and organizations to partner with we look at who we’re trying to reach and who the best messengers might be to reach those audiences our work with linmanuel miranda is a great example of that he speaks so passionately about puerto rico and the devastation it experienced after hurricane maria and about how climate change is making the storms worse he talks about these issues by putting their impact on people first— on people’s health on people’s livelihoods—the same way  does last year we ran a campaign with linmanuel and his wife vanessa where people could donate to  for a chance to win tickets to the opening night of hamilton in london he has this devoted audience of fans who want to win tickets but they’re also really open to his ideas and therefore our message you’re also seeking to increase brand awareness of  across audiences to help spread the word about the issues we work on what kind of partnerships have helped accomplish this one recent example of this is our campaign with ebay which has a builtin audience we want to speak to—in this case the american midwest our out reach resulted in  being chosen as ebay’s environmental partner for its earth month campaign in april ebay auctioned off celebrity gifts like a drum set from questlove and tickets to conan on its site with all the proceeds coming back to us you worked with funny or die on the get out the vote campaign prior to the 2018 midterm elections which culminated in a viral video and a live event in michigan why did you dede to use comedy to bring young people and new voters into the conversation we had partnered with funny or die a few times and when they launched their glam up the midterms campaign it seemed like a natural fit around our own get out the vote campaign the video—which featured the comedians and actors billy eichner randall park mandy moore kumail nanjiani and others—was based on the idea that young people can be apathetic voters it was called “nonvoters anonymous” and had various nonvoters “confess” their excuses deep down we were asking how do we reach those people who have checked out of the process and remind them that their vote really matters funny or die did a lot of research into youth campaigns and elections looking at what was resonating and what wasn’t it found that shaming wasn’t going to work instead the ultimate goal was to avoid talking down to young people and make them feel empowered to go vote we wanted to say “we understand you probably haven’t cared about this before—but now is the time” comedy helped us channel that message
