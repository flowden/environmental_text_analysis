 too much or too little can be deadly it can build up landscapes or carry them away it can transport lifegiving resources just as easily as pollution and invasive spees sometimes good sometimes bad but always essential – water rules the lives of people and wildlife throughout human history a community’s prosperity has depended in large part on its ability to adapt to and manage the quantity and quality of water flowing through it this ageold challenge continues today across the united states made more daunting by urban development increasing demand for fresh water and changing environmental conditions  supports new and innovative efforts to address this urgent need by empowering businesses and residents to work together to reduce urban runoff and mitigate the risk of floods in ways that bolster wildlife populations and increase public access to natural areas and parks a particularly effective example of such publicprivate partnerships can be found in southeast michigan where an enthusiastic team of conservation nonprofits businesses and community leaders is working to improve degraded natural habitats and deploy the latest innovations in “green infrastructure” to filter urban runoff and handle heavy flows during intense storms there in a landscape that alternates between farm fields suburbs and big ties workers are building retention ponds rain gardens and bioswales that capture stormwater runoff and allow excess nutrients to be used by native vegetation they are removing impervious surfaces that would otherwise send polluted runoff rushing into overloaded storm drains and eventually the great lakes they are installing green roofs that collect rainwater and advance techniques for ecologically sustainable development the southeast michigan resilience fund a collaboration between  and a number of corporate foundation and federal partners awarded approximately 15 million in grants in 2019 that will leverage 25 million in matching contributions to generate a total conservation impact of 4 million “some of the most effective places to do this type of conservation work are also the same places people go to get outside connect with nature and hopefully learn about the importance of conservation” said sarah clark director of land and water at southwest detroit environmental vision  awarded clark’s group a 300000 grant to plant 200 trees build green roofs and rain gardens and remove nearly 3 acres of impervious surfaces “through this work we expect to engage about 3000 community members a critical step in boosting communitybased stewardship of natural resources” in all these investments will add more than 24 million gallons of stormwater storage in the region providing relief to an area suffering from increasingly intense flooding “what we are seeing here in southeastern michigan could serve as a model for conservation for other areas of the country” said dr neil hawkins president of the fred a and barbara m erb family foundation one of the program’s funding partners “it’s the ultimate winwin scenario we’re giving flood waters a place to go we’re filtering pollutants from urban runoff and we’re enhanng critical pockets of habitat for songbirds pollinators and other types of wildlife”
