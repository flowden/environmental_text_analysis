 redung pollution—and energy bills—through energy effiency  worked with other energyeffiency advocates the us department of energy doe the paytv industry and equipment manufacturers to slash national electrity use of new settop boxes by 1 billion annually once in full effect the agreement will save three power plants’ worth of electrity and prevent the emission of 5 million tons of carbon pollution each year under the voluntary agreement leading cable satellite and telephone companies commit to buying more effient settop boxes and for the first time make the energy use of new boxes publicly available the agreement came after a yearlong negotiation spurred by ’s groundbreaking report that found settop boxes consume around 3 billion worth of electrity annually much of that when the box is turned off and due in large part to  advocacy the doe also published overdue effiency standards for motors commeral refrigeration walkin freezers and metal halide lamps that will save more than 38 billion annually—enough electrity to power almost 4 million american homes triclosan under pressure from an  lawsuit the us food and drug administration fda proposed a federal rule that if finalized would remove the potentially hazardous chemical triclosan from body washes and hand soaps the chemical is a suspected endrocrine disruptor and has been linked to reproductive and developmental harm in laboratory studies the fda first proposed removing triclosan from certain consumer products in 1978 but the agency took no final action and in the intervening years triclosan use has grown to such an extent that biomonitoring found residues of triclosan in 75 percent of americans over the age of six the chemical is absorbed through contact with the skin and tests have found it in human blood urine and even breast milk in 2010  sued the fda to force the agency to issue a final rule as part of that settlement the fda has issued its proposed rule and is committed to taking final action by 2016 in a related matter  filed a new lawsuit against fda seeking to obtain records the agency has withheld about possible health risks of triclosan added to toothpaste nanosilver the ninth rcuit court of appeals ruled in ’s favor that the environmental protection agency epa had improperly approved the use of nanosilver a toxic antimicrobial that can wash out of clothing and harm aquatic systems by ignoring its own finding of health risks from exposure to the chemical through the skin or through ingestion by toddlers as the court stated in its desion the epa had improperly approved the use of nanosilver by a us textile manufacturer when the epa’s own data showed that nanosilver was presely at levels that pose a potential risk the lawsuit was closely watched as a test case for the growing use of nanotechnology in consumer products such as fabrics and food storage containers—despite its potentially dangerous health effects this case and the court’s desion demonstrated that the epa is accountable for following its own safety standards bisphenola bpa more than 90 percent of the general population has harmful levels of bisphenola bpa in their bodies bpa is found in hard plastics the lining of food and beverage cans sales receipts and dental sealants and has been shown to mimic the female hormone estrogen in an explosion of studies since 2008 bpa exposure in test animals early in life has been assoated with cancer reproductive abnormalities and altered brain development armed with the sence parents and advocates called for bpa bans but california’s environmental protection agency failed to act so  filed a petition requesting bpa be added to a list of chemicals whose presence in products can trigger warning labels if exposures exceed regulatory levels with persistent pressure from  in january 2013 california’s epa announced it would add bpa to the list  will continue to push for safety warnings on products that contain bpa
