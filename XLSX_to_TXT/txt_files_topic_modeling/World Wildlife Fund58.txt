 the most effective way to ensure the longterm survival of plants and ani mals is through conservation of entire “ecoregions” see page 4 – extensive largely unspoilt places that support large numbers of spees the miombo savannah woodlands which cover 350 million hectares across ten countries of southern africa angola botswana democratic republic of congo malawi mozambique namibia south africa tanzania zambia and zimbabwe are home to some of the most important mammal populations left in africa among them are black rhino african elephant african hunting dog and cheetah along with the slendernosed crocodile and many lesserknown reptiles birds insects fish and plants more than half of the estimated 8500 plant spees there are found nowhere else on earth the biggest threat to wildlife is the large and rapidly growing human population and its demand for agricultural land in addition to forest clearance for crops wood is taken for building and fuel leaving increasingly large holes in forest cover as the soil becomes eroded and infertile so more woods are cleared and the cycle is repeated ’s response has been to develop programmes in which local communities manage their own resources the establishment of conservanes – in which fees are levied for the use of environmental resources – across southern africa is yielding significant benefits for nature and for people with profits ploughed back into the community through grants to local schools for  wildlife conservation is inextricably linked to human development
