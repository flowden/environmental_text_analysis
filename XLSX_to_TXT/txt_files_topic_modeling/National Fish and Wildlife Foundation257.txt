 of course not all of our nation’s bird spees live here yearround the red knot travels 9300 miles during a yearly migration from its breeding grounds in the canadian arctic to south american wintering sites each spring many of these large sandpipers stop to feed on the eggs of spawning horseshoe crabs on the delaware bay’s beaches but horseshoe crabs have been heavily harvested in recent years causing their populations to dwindle—and the red knot is paying the price since 1980 the red knot population on the atlantic and gulf coasts has declined from at least 100000 to 14800 nearly half of today’s red knots don’t complete their migration journey they often starve en route  has identified the red knot initiative as another investment opportunity likely to yield meaningful conservation returns through past investments in the western hemisphere shorebird reserve network  has helped build a strong coalition now poised to reverse the knot’s decline we also are supporting the us geological survey in its development of sentific models that will allow effective management of horseshoe crab populations in addition grantees and partners will continue to develop means of protecting critical coastal beaches and mudflats and minimizing disturbance to knots searching for food during their migratory journey
