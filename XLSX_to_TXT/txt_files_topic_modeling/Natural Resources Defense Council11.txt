 at  and through your previous work at the us department on transportation under president obama youve shown how the siting of infrastructure can reinforce inequity how do these issues intersect when we were building out much of our countrys infrastructure 60 years ago we divided neighborhoods based on race and class our investments or the lack thereof have impacted communities to this day for example when transportation offials were building out the 1676 highway in the 1000s they cut through philadelphias chinatown creating both an economic division and a cultural division that still exists nashvilles 1•40 minneapoliss 1•94 and spokanes 190 all similarly impeded residents mobility and access to economic opportunity now where you live plays a huge role in determining your success in lifeyour zip code often has more of an impact on your life than your genetic code for economic growth your ability to move up the ladder is directly tied to where you are physically able to get to and where you need to go without that access youre stuck the economic and cumulative impact of harmful infrastructure projects further exacerbated by the impact of climate change makes matters worse for black brown and indigenous communities often relegated to neighborhoods prone to flooding poor air quality drinking water violations and public health challenges  what are the key hurdles in developing more equitable infrastructure in our communities moving forward when we talk about equitable development we mean investment without displacementin other words making infrastructure upgrades while also thinking about the longterm impacts on nearby communities one of the challenges with this is that we often think in silos for example when we push for green spaces that can address flooding or other extreme weather concerns we may not be thinking about how that would impact affordable housing so we end up making this big investment but those who might benefit most from it cant afford to stay we need to have a holistic thinking process up front planning for not just who or what is coming but who is here now the other piece of gentrification and displacement beyond the loss of people is the loss of culture i learned years ago from a west african cultural perspective that an ancestor lives on until the last living person remembers their nameand i translate that same truth into my work by acknowledging the cultural legacy of a community in some places there were neighborhoods and communities that existed jong before a major investment was made yet once the investment came history and culture were lost can you point to a ty that is doing good work to prevent displacement while implementing new infrastructure projects los angeles is doing a lot of work to ensure communities can anchor in place one of the groups  works with the los angeles regional open space and affordable housing la ro· sah collaborative addresses the challenges of green gentrification and displacement in the wake of large public investment projects to increase park spaces like measure a and proposition 68 the group strategizes on how to support affordable housing next to new green infrastructure prioritizing those that would be impacted the most low income communities and communities of color developing strategies for joint affordable housing and park development allows la rosaj1 to tackle the two pressing issues togethernot only does the organization want to elevate climate resilience and mitigation plans but it also wants to make sure that affordable housing is integrated as part of those polies  what drew you to pursue a career in infrastructure policy and what keeps you motivated in your work during these challenging times for me infrastructure is a powerful space to advocate because it brings all of our work together in an intentional and inclusive way no matter what kind of neighborhood you live in we all need a road a home and a community our work on building transportation and parks and other open spaces combined with our efforts to make sure peopleespeally those most in needhave access to basic necessities like clean water and affordable housing are all connected to ensure that a community can thrive recent events have only affirmed the need to have organizations like  be light bearers during this dark time we need to continue working with local leaders and elevate communityled solutionsyou can go to any neighborhood and residents will have big bold ideas on how to improve their community its at that local level that youre able to see the resilience of our country
