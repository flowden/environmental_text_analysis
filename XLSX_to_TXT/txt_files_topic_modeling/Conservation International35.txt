 if humanity vanished tomorrow nature would go on without us yet we are totally dependent on nature every breath every bite every drop our health and our prosperity—it all comes from nature our oceans forests rivers wetlands and savannahs are our lifelines despite this the natural world is being chopped down burned poisoned and used up at an alarming rate the convergence of ecological loss with the impacts of a changing climate and a rapidly growing global population is creating the perfect storm in just four decades there will be more than 9 billion people living on earth and the global middle class will jump from 1 billion to 3 billion global demand for water energy and food will double conflicts between and within nations for water and the other goods and services that nature provides may intensify if we do not change the course we’re on we will need two earths to sustain us we only have one this challenge may seem insurmountable but it is not communities businesses and governments across the globe are waking up to the severity of the problems we face to the interconnectedness of our pale blue dot and to the reality that saving nature is the only way to save ourselves at  we have responded by refining our strategy to become more focused and better positioned to find transformative solutions we are identifying and protecting the spectacular but vulnerable places on land and at sea working with the private sector to promote sustainable business practices and engaging with governments to ensure they have the knowledge and tools to make desions that will benefit humanity now and for generations to come in fy13 we narrowed our focus to six geographic priorities amazonia the eastern tropical pafic seascape the pafic oceanscape the greater mekong region indonesia and subsaharan africa these places were selected because of their unique concentrations of natural wealth because leaders in the regions have demonstrated a willingness to think outside the box when it comes to securing the economic and soal stability of their people and because these geographies are large enough to show measurable impact at scale within these geographies and at a global scale we provide critical tools to businesses governments and others to help them make informed desions regarding their natural wealth in fy13 we launched the ocean health index wwwoceanhealthindexorg the first comprehensive openaccess global assessment of our oceans and the benefits they provide to people read more about the ocean health index on page 18 throughout fy13 we also engaged the private sector—because no effort to protect our planet will be successful if it fails to ensure that business can continue to be an engine for economic growth and jobs without further depleting the foundation of our natural wealth we revitalized our business and sustainability counl—a corporate forum where members can collaborate with ’s sentific and sustainability experts and each other to share success stories and pilot new and innovative demonstration projects we also worked with many companies directly including but not limited to exxon mobil bhp billiton starbucks and nestlé frequently the reach of our engagement extended well beyond our partners in the case of nestlé we gathered satellite data from 32 supplier countries to show which regions within the countries are most at risk from deforestation nestlé is using this information to source its top commodities more sustainably—and sharing these results with the 400 members of the consumer goods forum all of whom have committed to achieving zeronet deforestation from their global supply chains by 2020 read more about our work with nestlé on page 24 finally we worked with all sectors of soety in fy13 to ensure that the places that sustain humanity are safeguarded achieving largescale ontheground results requires building trust with a range of stakeholders—which takes both time and honesty—but as we saw throughout the year the payoff is immense since 2000  has worked closely with partners in the guiana shield in south america to secure wilderness areas and to prevent deforestation our efforts began in brazil and expanded to suriname and guyana this year we made great progress working with suriname’s indigenous communities to identify and map the places that are espeally important to their culture economy and recreation the maps have formed a key input for the pending creation of what will be the final piece of the largest contiguous protected primary forest in the world an area covering 14 million hectares in the pafic  has worked alongside island leaders since 2006 to help them safeguard their natural wealth initially we provided counsel and support to president anote tong of kiribati on the design and implementation of the phoenix island protected area others in the region hoped to follow in kiribati’s footsteps but the challenges of securing vast ocean expanses loomed undaunted  worked closely with the pafic islands forum and regional agenes to design the pafic oceanscape an ambitious framework for sustainably managing 10 percent of the ocean’s surface endorsed by the leaders of 15 pafic island countries in 2010 in fy13 members of the pafic islands forum made historic commitments to ocean conservation including a 12millionsquare kilometer marine park in the cook islands and a 14millionsquarekilometer marine protected area in new caledonia and four years after its launch an effort in peru’s alto mayo protected forest— with partners as diverse as the peruvian government disney and local smallholder farmers—has reduced carbon emissions from deforestation by 25 million metric tons the equivalent of taking 500000 cars off the road for a year read more about our work in alto mayo on page 12 but this is just a snapshot of the vital work we’re doing as you’ll see in the pages that follow we are taking many more bold actions to protect our planet and ensure human wellbeing around the world these successes are shaping our future and as we succeed will define who we are and why  is a speal institution we have extraordinary drive and a commitment to constantly learn and improve we also know that success depends upon our ability to partner with others in fact every effort is carried out in close collaboration with carefully selected truly exceptional organizations we are actively involved in productive partnerships with the governments of china the united states the eu france japan brazil indonesia cambodia peru colombia guyana suriname botswana liberia south africa kiribati the cook islands and fiji we have deepening relationships with major foundations and multilateral agenes such as the gates foundation the rockefeller foundation the walton family foundation the world bank and the inter american development bank and finally  could not exist without the amazing commitment and generosity of our many donors and supporters it is an
