 the 2019 united nations climate summit had an urgent mission  the wake of the latest lpcc report that showed what were up against if we dont drastically reduce pollution from coalfired plants worldwide what was the outcome of that meeting unfortunately most of the national leaders who attended the summit missed the opportunity to demonstrate that they are on the right side of sence and history meanwhile multinational oil and gas companies hosted their own meeting in new york seeking positive press for making relatively small commitments to reduce emissions without actually shifting the majority of their fossil fuel investments but outside the summit were seeing some true positive momentum on the global stage several developed countriesgermany france and norway to name just a fewhave actually doubled their pledges to the green climate fund the worlds largest unilateral fund for climate action while india and china are still planning to build new coal plants domestically both countries also continue to install renewable energy at a record pace and many countries plan to announce that they are setting even more ambitious climate targets in 2020 as part of the paris agreements next phase although china is currently the worlds largest emitter of carbon dioxide its also the worlds biggest investor in  renewable energy what are the most encouraging signs in chinas energy polies for one thing the climate discourse in china isnt as rooted in partisan ideology as it is here and theres not the same concerted disinformation campaign the discussion about energy policy there tends to focus on economic and environmental gains as opposed to politics thats why china is already seriously discussingat both the national and local levelsthings like a ban on sales of int emal combustion engine vehicles or converting public bus fleets to 100 percent electric vehicles china has more than twice as much installed wind and solar power capaty as the united states and its emissions per capita are only half what they are in our country so whats most hopeful and encouraging about chinas energy policy is that it has already figured out how to decouple economic growth from carbon intensity its polies recognize the economic advantages inherent in developing renewables batteries and other technologies despite the trump administrations disastrous actions to thwart climate action we often hear about how the renewable energy sector is booming here in the united states how does our renewables sector compare with those of other developed countries other countries are illustrating how implementing polies early on in order to drive renewable energy is absolutely key to decarbonizing germany currently gets almost 23 percent of its power generation from wind and solar thats three times higher than the percentage here in the united states denmark gets 51 percent of its power generation from wind and solar 80th countries supported the wind and solar industries in their early stages of development and both countries hae shown that theyre serious about updating their national climate legislation to be in line with commitments made as part of the paris agreement america needs to follow their lead by passing serious ambitious legislation on the local state and federal levels what is the role of  in pushing for that action in times like these  isnt in the business of simply commenting on existing policy it actively drives new policy globally to help us all deal with this unbelievably complex and difficult threat  is wining to challenge government policy campaign publicly and advocate fiercely for the climate action we need its this strategy that made me want to be a part of the organization when i walked in for my first job interview in 2015 and saw the office logo the earths best defense  is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year what is your vision for the environmental movement and the planet 5o years from now i think our concept of growth will need to focus on the quality of economic development not just on raw numbers by themselves like gop or net profit the power of collective action taken by millionssuch as the recent series of youthled global climate strikeswill have helped us to understand the hidden costs of focusing only on highlevel statistics and ignoring the impacts on individuals and the environment in 50 years the earth and its natural systems will hopefully have had some time to recover from centuries of human driven greenhouse gas emissions of course this assumes that within the next few decades well have shifted from creating more greenhouse gas emissions to redung them if we can do that though we will have shifted from causing disastrous ecological damage to beginning a new era of better planetary stewardship by individuals communities and nations
