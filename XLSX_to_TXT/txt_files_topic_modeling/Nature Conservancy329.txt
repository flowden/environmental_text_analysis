 dora kamweneshe is the manager of the zambia rivers and wetlands programme for zambia “one major lesson that i have learned from this study exchange is the value of partnerships among institutions toward a common goal the partnership that  has developed with the corps of engineers in terms of integrated resource management is of great value to me because you have environmentalists and engineers putting their heads together for the common goal of water management another thing that really struck me was the interdisplinary approach to water management we will be able to go back home and draw on various expertise and plan together for the sake of both energy production and the environment so that there doesn’t have to be a compromise we have to find a balance if we want to manage the zambezi river basin sustainably both for the development of the region and also for the conservation of the environment”
