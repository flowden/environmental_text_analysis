 the ocean is a noisy place sound travels four times faster in water than in air and many marine creatures have evolved highly sensitive hearing to help guide them through life’s most basic functions foraging finding a mate avoiding predators communicating and navigating but whale songs and dolphin clicks pale in comparison with the man­made sounds of the sea the seismic surveys that companies use to prospect for oil and gas produce some of the loudest sounds we make in the ocean their relentless airgun blasts which erupt every 10 seconds for months on end can be heard thousands of miles away not only does this undersea cacophony make life hard for marine mam­mals but it also injures and kills invertebrates like squid and scallops and displaces fish which can have a devastating impact on coastal economies that’s why  and our allies filed a lawsuit in december after the national marine fisheries service issued five new permits allowing intensive airgun blasting in large areas off the atlantic coast from delaware to central florida “this is a license for private for­ profit companies to com­pletely change life in the sea” says michael jasny director of ’s marine mammal protection project “and it’s the first step in exploiting the ocean treasures we all own—all in a reck­ less quest for more fossil fuels that speed up climate change” the fight to end harmful seismic testing is years in the making after multiple groups of sentists warned the obama administration about its widespread impacts offi­als eventually agreed that airgun blasting in the atlan­tic was too risky but shortly after taking office president trump disregarded that precedent in april 2017 he issued an executive order attempting to open up public coastal waters to offshore drilling see page 58 and the seismic surveys that come with it “we’ll stand together with all the communities coastal businesses sentists lawmakers and commeral and recre­ational fishermen who oppose seismic blasting” jasny says “and we will fight this illegal action”
