 dear friends what if we really have only a few years left to secure a sustainable future for earth what should we do what must we do a slew of recent sentific reports including the latest report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change spell out for the first time not just what is at stake but also a deadline for meaningful action on our part the window for effective intervention it turns out is about a decade the sum of our actions now will determine our planet’s livability for centuries to come this “what if” question is stark failure to answer might seem terrifying in my heart i share this weight this nagging fear but we at  also find this challenge clarifying and hugely motivating asking “what if” is forng us to rethink everything— to align our energies toward the most critical problems to envision and execute solutions that are bigger than anything we had thought possible and to fastforward our organization’s evolution to deliver outsized results as you will read in the pages of this report  is seizing this unique moment to meaningfully change not just what’s going to happen on the planet tomorrow but what will forever be we’ve identified four critical areas — protecting and restoring nature for climate massively increasing global ocean protection leading scalable models of sustainability in key places around the world and innovating in sence and finance to accelerate conservation everywhere — that together form our answer to the “what if” question these opportunities give us worldwide the greatest possible leverage to jolt earth back toward a sustainable course in some way i have never been more optimistic about our work and for our future than i am today that’s because  and its hundreds of partners worldwide are also using a “what if” approach to turn those four opportunities into action for nature and climate for instance we stepped back and asked “what if nature had its own seat at the climate table what would that look like” that framing quickly led us to not only protecting intact tropical forests and mangroves but also to reforestation often through partnerships asking “what if” has spurred us to throw out conventional playbooks in search of the transformative answers that earth needs we’re also turning the “what if” question on ourselves asking how  needs to grow to deliver solutions at scale for these planetary challenges the ideal  is both big and small — with the capaty resources and longterm commitment of a big organization to move the needle on wicked problems but with the flexibility agility and cohesive culture typical of smaller organizations and that’s the  we’re building — hiring people with great values and assembling them into highly cohesive nimble teams with radical transparency throughout in my travels around the world this year i have seen an organization that can answer “what if” questions even in the most resourcestrapped situations — from liberia where we partnered with the government to launch that country’s first trust fund for protected areas to timorleste where we are helping one of the newest countries on earth set up its entire national park system on a very modest budget we are in an exponential race and our solutions cannot be incremental our answers to “what if” are clear compelling and exponential — and we’re not wasting a second in making them reality
