 last year when i agreed to chair  i said that i aimed to support our mission with consence passion and soul what brought me here was my work as a telecommunications entrepreneur but what made me want to serve in this capaty was my love of the natural world i suspect that’s why all of us are here whether trustees team members or donors we all share this passion this connection to nature  has been described as pragmatic nonconfrontational and nonpartisan in its methods these descriptions might imply a dispassionate approach and that image is one of the inconsistenes i grapple with in my role as a leader here it is true that we rely heavily on sence and our desions are determined more by rational thinking than by emotions it is also true that we try to bring everyone to the table—the alreadycommitted alongside those with a lessthanstellar environmental past what transcends it all however is our sacred duty to protect the earth’s ecosystem with all the passion we can muster the process of working with others to find simple solutions to seemingly intractable problems is a great joy to me and i celebrate winwin solutions we at  want to help people achieve economic progress while working handinhand to protect and sustain clean air pure water and a healthy planet for future generations
