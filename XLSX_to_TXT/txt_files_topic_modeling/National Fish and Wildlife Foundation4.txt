 when the foundation has worked on a topic for some years the key to sustaining progress becomes the degree to which we push innovation grants that are truly innovative for example propose new research angles on persistent enigmas or offer us chances to drive new practices quickly from research into better ontheground habitat management  grants to support research into the complex life of salmon are a good example anadromous salmon spend part of their lives in freshwater and perhaps more than half their lives in oceans—until recently the inaccessibility of this period to researchers has hampered efforts to picture a normal salmon lifespan and thus to help restore the spees here’s where innovation comes in as part of a series of  grants to prbo conservation sence researchers are indirectly delineating the life of salmon at sea by studying pelagic seabirds those that haunt the open ocean such birds are “salmon with wings” for they gather in the same marine areas as salmon—at upwellings and eddies—to feed on the same prey this pelagic seabird research is helping us to relate seabird population changes to those of salmon otherwise immeasurable the condition of salmon in the open ocean can be inferred from the health of pelagic bird populations thus the spark of innovation in research helps to identify and understand what helps salmon to survive at sea
