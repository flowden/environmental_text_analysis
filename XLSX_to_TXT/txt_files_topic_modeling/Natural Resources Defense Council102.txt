 not long after art and helen tanderup retired transcanada began trying to claim areas of the couple’s 160acre nebraska farm so the energy company could run its keystone xl pipeline a mere 600 feet from their house the company was negotiating easements with local landowners in order to secure a route for its multibilliondollar project a 1179milelong pipeline that would transport a minimum of 830000 barrels of dirty tar sands oil per day from canada’s boreal forest across the us border and down through this midwestern state owned by helen’s family for more than a century the tanderups’ home sits in nebraska’s eastern sand hills and directly over the ogallala aquifer a primary source of water for a vast stretch of the country’s agricultural heartland “we have two kids and we hope to pass this farm on to them and our grandchildren” art says “if this pipeline’s here we don’t know what we’ll do” although transcanada had some early takers many nebraskans along the proposed keystone xl route questioned the pipeline’s safety the risks to their water supply and the legality of the oil company’s tactics with the help of an organizer named jane kleeb republicans and democrats ranchers and native tribes country folk and ty dwellers banded together with the organization bold nebraska to forge a unified resistance to keystone xl part of the battle cry for the pipelinefighting tanderups and others has been to “leave tar sands in the ground” and invest instead in renewable energy sources as a means to address global climate change it’s a fight that  has been championing for more than a decade in partnership with other environmental groups and first nations communities that have inhabited canada’s boreal forest for thousands of years when the tar sands oil industry began working to exploit the forest in the mid1990s members of these communities spoke out detailing the risks of the oil operation to their water their fishing and hunting traditions and their health in 2005 they invited canadian activist groups and  to alberta to talk about tar sands and they asked for help in stopping the devastation of the boreal shortly thereafter  launched the first campaign by a us organization against the expanding tar sands industry “we had to show people that the united states was a driver for what was happening up there” says danielle droih senior policy analyst for ’s canada project “it was the united states that had the solution and ability to effect change” meanwhile the people of the cornhusker state have continued their opposition to the keystone xl pipeline anthony swift director of the canada project says “there’s no question that nebraskans know more than most people how high the stakes are” they’ve kept up their fight through years of protest and courtroom battles a rigorous us state department environmental review that echoed the concerns of pipeline resisters and the conflicting desions of the obama administration to reject keystone xl and the trump administration to later authorize it many bold nebraska members testified during public hearings before the nebraska public service commission psc in the spring of 2017 and some returned to the podium as registered interveners a few months later when five days of formal arguments led the psc to issue an offial desion denying the company’s preferred route through the state outside nebraska the battle is simultaneously playing out in federal court in montana where  bold alliance and partner groups northern plains resource counl center for biological diversity friends of the earth and  have sued the trump administration for unlawfully issuing a crossborder permit for the project though the administration and transcanada pushed to have the lawsuit thrown out a federal judge denied that request—further bolstering the efforts of  bold nebraska and other groups working to stop keystone xl once and for all currently bold nebraska is hosting meetings to bring together concerned landowners and other community members in the counties newly affected by keystone xl’s revised route their fight has been long but kleeb and her community keep the faith how do they do it “we fundamentally see this as such a wrong project that for us there’s no other way to look at it” she says without hesitation “we have no option but to think that our work will stop this pipeline again”
