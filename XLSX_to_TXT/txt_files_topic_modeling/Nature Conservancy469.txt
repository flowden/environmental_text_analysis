habitat solution use of hightech sonar to study the bay bottom a quarter of the bay scallops harvested in the united states came from the peconic estuary—until brown algae invaded in 1985 and smothered the scallops to restore the scallop population sentists with the us environmental protection agency stony brook university and the conservancy are using sonar to map the bay bottom in six areas from flanders bay to northeast of gardiners island the sonar sends acoustic signals to the bottom of the bay and reveals what’s below on a laptop computer the technology enables sentists to search for eelgrass meadows a nursery spawning area and refuge for many marine organisms including bay scallops information gained from the study will help sentists restore the bay habitat and support better marine conservation in the peconic estuary the mission of  is to preserve the plants animals and natural communities that represent the diversity of life on earth by protecting the lands and
