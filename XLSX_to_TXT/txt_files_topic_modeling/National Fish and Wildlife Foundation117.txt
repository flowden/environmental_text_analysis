 throughout the hawaiian islands  and its partners are fighting on the front lines of bird conservation in a place sometimes referred to as the “extinction capital of the world” funded projects are helping to slow or reverse declines for rare and endemic spees such as the palila nihoa millerbird and maui parrotbill along with disappearing seabird spees such as the hawaiian petrel and laysan albatross to make a difference on the ground for hawaii’s diverse collection of unique colorful and critically imperiled birds biologists are using the newest and most effective conservation tools pioneering methods supported by  include the protection of groundnesting seabirds with advanced fenng capable of deterring everything from goats to cats and even mice at one of hawaii’s most remote nesting colonies new acoustic and visual sensors help sentists keep tabs on seabirds and nonnative predators of all the conservation tools being put to work in hawaii translocation and the reintroduction of spees remain some of the most powerful and effective in 2015 biologists initiated a project to establish a colony of endangered hawaiian petrels at a national wildlife refuge on kaua‘i by translocating chicks from a remote mountaintop colony to newly restored habitat protected by a funded predatorproof fence in addition albatross eggs were translocated from a navy missile test range on kaua‘i to a refuge on o‘ahu where the chicks were raised by hand one new project in particular captured the public’s attention in 2015 leveraging a  grant state and federal wildlife offials joined the san diego zoo to launch a bold plan to reintroduce the ‘alala or hawaiian crow to the island of hawaii the ‘alala restoration working group is supporting an intensive captive breeding and reintroduction program with the goal of releasing 1113 birds into the upper ka‘u forest reserve and pu‘u makaala natural area reserve each year for five years starting in 2016 “the last bird disappeared in 2002 so a lot of people have never even seen an ‘alala in the wild” said john vetter a state wildlife biologist involved in the project “this spees is important ecologically and it’s important culturally and they’re very charismatic birds – they’re large and loud and they make very interesting calls i think just seeing them on the landscape again will get people really exted”
