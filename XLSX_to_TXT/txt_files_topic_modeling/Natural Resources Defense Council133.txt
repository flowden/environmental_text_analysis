 why is  focusing on ties we’re not going to be able to solve problems like climate change unless we look at how ties are built and make it possible for people who live and work in urban areas to thrive while decreasing their environmental footprint so our big goal is to protect the planet while making our ties and communities livable and affordable at the same time how does your work intersect with ’s expertise we’re building on decades of experience in urban policy and the technical aspects of making ties as climatefriendly and resilient as possible working in close collaboration with community partners we’re turning that expertise into a set of problemsolving strategies that take our advocacy efforts and legal work to a new level helping accelerate change on the ground why is it important to work alongside partners at the community level ties are very complex places with a wide range of stakeholders  has technical expertise in a lot of areas but there is a lot we don’t know about ties we rely on the knowledge of people who live and work in these places we’ve committed to allocating grants to our partners that are equal to 25 percent of our overall budget this is to ensure that the change we’re driving is longlasting we want to see our partners’ capaties grow and ensure that residents are the champions and problem solvers of their own communities what communities have you worked with one example is little tokyo in los angeles it’s under enormous development pressures and as southern california’s last major japanese community the residents were worried about losing their culture they wanted little tokyo to be the emblem of sustainable revitalization my team has helped to falitate discussions around building a vision and strategy that are now being taken to the mayor’s office  was able to make use of our vast networks in the region to attract smart and sustainable investment into the community this project is now providing a model for how the ty of los angeles can grow more sustainably what is your vision for our ties i want to see affordable multifamily buildings that are as energyeffient as any other building in a community—that will help the poorest people in those areas to save money i would also really like to see more ties making it possible for people to live without cars particularly for people who are lowincome the price of admission to the job market should not be car ownership and i’d like to see more communities adopt strategies that support access to local healthy food so that people can improve their wellbeing with our deep technical bench as well as the community partnerships and networks we’ve built  is wellpositioned to drive these kinds of changes
