 in 1969 one year before s founding an offshore oil spill spewed three million tons of crude into the waters off santa barbara what was  doing about offshore drilling when you came on board the santa barbara spill was a seminal trigger for the passage of key environmental laws like the national environmental policy act when l arrived in 1973 two of nrocs founders ed strohbehn and tom stoel had sued to stop the nixon administration from pursuing a lease sale in the gulf of mexico but it wasnt until the carter administration that offshore drilling really become a national issue as oil prices skyrocketed carter led a push for energy independence and his interior department offered the first lease sales in the atlantic ocean but there was no thorough assessment of environmental impacts and no meaningful consultation with coastal communities that could be impacted by the drilling so frances beinecke and i launched s coastal project some 30 years before frances became the organizations president we worked to strengthen the outer continental shelf lancs act we didnt get everything we wanted but the 1978 amendments brought about the five year offshore drilling planning process which was designed to make the leasing process more rational and transparent after the amendments passed we challenged the first five year plan in court and won and then came the reagan years how did having a foe of environmental protection in the white house change your tactics reagans interior secretary james watt perverted the planning process he had a religious fervor about mans obligation to develop the natural resources of the earth he was really a zealot watt proposed leasing a billion acres along with several coastal states  challenged the plan in its entirety in court we jost but didnt give up we brought legal challenges to individual lease sales off alaska new england and california the lawsuits bought congress time to act the administration had so overreached that members of congress started putting riders on appropriations bills to prevent lease sales in their states coastal waters while i was in court lisa speer who now oversees our lnternational oceans division was working on the hili to support passage of these riders by the end of the 1980s almost the entire outer continental shelf aside from the central and western gulf of mexico was protected by riders it was amazing after the exxon valdez spill in 1989 president george h w bush issued a presidential withdrawal of many of these areas protecting them from drilling and president clinton extended the withdrawals we had most of the continental shelf offlimits to drilling for more than 20 years it was due in large measure to watts overreach and the opposition that ensued one of s greatest victories was ushering in a permanent ban on drilling in parts of the arctic and atlantic oceans this came during obamas second term what was the significance of that act it was huge weve been fighting alongside local people and fishing groups to protect alaskas coasts since the 1980s see what will it take to save the last frontierÂ» page 54 as for the atlantic we brought sentists together in 2000 to identify important ecological areas for protection they highlighted the offshore deep sea canyons where the upwelling of nutrients creates vital feeding areas for fish whales and dolphins the hard substrate carved into the continental shelf is also home to deep sea corals and sponges safeguarding these magnificent areas is critical which is why nroc is now in court defending president obamas offshore withdrawals from being overturned so now that  is back to fighting offshore drilling in courts and in legislatures around the country does it feel reminiscent of the 1970s and 1980s in some ways by proposing to open up vast areas off virtually every coastline to drilling the trump administration has overreachedthe same mistake watt made and just like in the 1980s were seeing bipartisan opposition for example in florida and other places along the southeastern coast republicans and democrats have come together to stop offshore drilling  has been fighting to protect our oceans for 60 years and you have been there for 46 of them what are your hopes for the oceans for the next 60 years can we fix whats broken three of the most important things we can do to restore and protect the ocean are to substantially reduce greenhouse emissions end overfishing and expand protected areas for example sentists are now calling for protecting at least 30 percent of the worlds oceans by 2030 as a way to promote resilience in the face of climate change nroc is working on all these fronts to ensure that the ocean continues to sustain marine life and support the hundreds of millions of people who rely on it for their sustenance livelihoods and way of life
