 growing up in new england amanda leland always loved the sea her greatgrandfather was a lobsterman and as a kid she would fish for “blues” with her grandfather the decline of the new england cod fishery inspired her career in marine sence leland now ’s senior vp for oceans recalls a fisherman once telling her “if i don’t catch the last fish someone else will” she grew convinced that fishermen shouldn’t have to choose between conserving the resource and providing for their families and as a marine biologist she knew that smart management could unleash the ocean’s natural resilience and achieve a dramatic recovery in fish populations  has championed an innovative approach that grants fishermen secure rights to fish now and in the future this creates more of an incentive to fish sustainably because local fishermen and their communities benefit economically as the fishery grows and catch limits are raised “with secure fishing rights” says leland “fishermen’s incentives flip from catching as much as possible today to protecting the fishery for the long term” globally three billion people rely on seafood as an important source of protein but 40 of the world’s fisheries are in trouble climate change habitat loss ocean pollution and other threats contribute to the problem but overfishing is the leading cause of fishery depletion worldwide now new research by  and partners at the university of california at santa barbara and the university of washington quantifies the immense potential of fisheries to recover if we manage them properly presented at the 2015 world ocean summit in lisbon our research shows that sustainable fishing could more than double the number of fish in the water by 2050 in most places when compared to current trends a typical fishery could recover in just nine years ’s growing list of successes in the united states belize and mexico demonstrates what’s possible with the right set of polies and incentives we’re now focusing on a dozen governments that account for more than threefifths of the global catch including the european union where we helped reform the common fisheries policy committing europe to end overfishing by 2020 reforms at this scale could tip the global fishing economy so that sustainable methods of catching fish take hold worldwide
