 a year ago california kicked off america’s most ambitious climate solution—a capandtrade program covering 350 of the state’s largest greenhouse gas polluters previously power plants and other highpolluting falities in the state could dump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere for free now they must buy allowances sold periodically at auction for whatever amount of carbon they emit the idea is to drive down carbon emissions by making it more profitable not to pollute after four auctions in the first 12 months all signs point to a robust carbonreduction market with longterm viability prices indicate companies can cut pollution at a reasonable cost the auctions also raised almost 400 million to invest in projects that cut climate pollution and stimulate the clean energy economy it all started with the state’s landmark bipartisan 2006 climate bill the global warming solutions act which  cosponsored and defended in court and at the polls the law requires the state to reduce climate pollution to 1990 levels by 2020 in addition to launching the world’s largest economywide capand trade program california has set rigorous standards for cleaner cars renewable energy and lowcarbon fuels sparking innovations in the way utilities generate electrity automakers design cars and refineries make fuel for example the low carbon fuel standard lcfs is driving demand for biodiesel “propel relocated to california to benefit from polies like lcfs” says matt horton ceo of propel fuels a biodiesel company all this translates into jobs cleantech employment in california has grown four times faster than all jobs in the state and california has cut carbon emissions by nearly 20 in just five years the golden state’s new carbon market has helped set the stage for capandtrade programs globally including the linkage of california’s and quebec’s carbon markets in early 2014 and a partnership with china’s emerging market
