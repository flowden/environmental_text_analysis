 campaigning at tes patagonian toothfish one of the most valuable fish on earth was one of a number of spees for which  campaigned for greater protection under the tes convention at the november 2002 meeting of member countries the patagonian toothfish fetches as much as us60 per kilogram on the japanese market and up to us40 on the european and us markets where it is usually sold under the name of chilean sea bass currently international regulation is inadequate to prevent “pirate” fishermen from catching up to four times the legal catch of the fish and then selling it to the legal market the toothfish is acutely vulnerable because it grows slowly to a length of two metres and does not start to breed until over six years old in some areas of the pafic the toothfish has declined by as much as 99 per cent by strengthening international wildlife protection laws through con ventions such as tes catches can be regulated and fish stocks better man aged to meet global market demands ’s work on the patagonian tooth fish shows that sustainable development and spees conservation can go hand in hand africa’s great apes africa is home to four of the six spees of great apesall four are endangered in particular the mountain gorilla of which about 650 individuals survive in two groups these great apes face a number of threats each year illegal hunting and trade account for 3000 to 6000 apes – killed for their meat logging of forests in west and central africa continues to reduce habitat and roads built through forests allow easier access for poachers apes are susceptible to many of the same viruses and parasites as humans and have suffered as a result in gombe national park in tanzania for instance scabies pneumonia and gut parasites have caused an almost 40 per cent decline in chimpanzeesand with increasing human expansion people and apes are coming into conflict more regularly with apes raiding crops and being killed as a result in 2002  renewed its efforts to counter these threats and save the continent’s dwindling numbers of primates protection of the apes’ forest home is one priority along with winning community support for their conservation strengthening the numbers and the training of park guards and staff lobbying for stronger laws to protect the spees redung illegal trade and increasing public awareness – particularly among the young – of the plight in which africa’s great apes find themselves fighting for whales in spite of the ban on commeral whaling imposed by the international whaling commission iwcmore than 1300 whales are being killed each year and the number is rising is trying hard to get this either stopped or brought under tight control at the 2002 iwc meeting in the japanese whaling port of shimonoseki  helped ensure that the prowhaling nations espeally japan and norway were outvoted in their attempts to resume commeral whaling the meeting however was notable for its blatant political games furious at their failure to obtain a commeral quota of minke whales japan and its group of supporting countries managed to deny the alaskan inuit and russian chukotkans their legitimate traditional annual hunt of a small number of bowhead whales – which they depend upon for their subsistence better news came from the south pafic where ’s successful campaign to encourage pafic island nations to declare their exclusive eco nomic zones eez as whale sanctuaries gathered pace the cook islands niue french polynesia papua new guinea and samoaas well as mexico were among countries whichtogether brought the total area of eez sanctuaries in the pafic close to 12 million square kilometres png’s prime minister sir mekere morauta said “papua new guinea’s waters cover migratory routes and may contain important breeding grounds for whalesour desion will help pro tect some of the whale spees that are at risk from commeral hunting” giant panda corridors a  project in china is aiming to create new panda reserves preventing large areas of continuous habitat from being broken up and establishing “green” corridors linking protected areas in the qinling mountains of shaanxi provincethe qinling mountains are extremely rich in wildlife and are home to a number of endan gered spees such as the golden mon key crested ibis golden eagle and clouded leopard – as well as being one of the few remaining areas where wild ecoregion pandas live “qinling is expected to become the first network of protected areas that enables the free movement of – and genetic exchange between – different groups of giant pandas” said wu haohan ’s qinling project leader “the experience gained in qinling can be used in other panda areas as well as for other animals fang the same fragmentation of their habitat porpoise in peril the number of harbour porpoises in the north sea was estimated in 1994 at between 267000 and 465000 with fewer than 600 in the baltic sea how many animals remain today is unknown but with at least 7000 dying every year in nets set on the seafloor to catch cod turbot and plaice con cerns for the future of the mammal are rising ’s plan to save the spees includes halting fishing in areas of high acdental “bycatch” the use of “pingers” boxes attached to fishing nets which emit a sound that discourages porpoises from entering the net and a reduction in the use of deadly gill nets in the north sea a first step will be a new survey to establish their current distribution and numbers
