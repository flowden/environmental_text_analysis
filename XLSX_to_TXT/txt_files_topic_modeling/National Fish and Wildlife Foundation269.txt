 puget sound in washington teems with life chinook and sockeye salmon rockfish and lingcod harbor seals doublecrested and pelagic cormorants—it’s a smorgasbord of marine life beneath the water’s surface however lies a threat that takes a terrible toll abandoned and derelict fishing gear crab traps gill nets and monofilament line kill indiscriminately for years through ’s marine debris removal partnership with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration a grant to the northwest straits foundation is helping clear the sound of these killers and also providing some startling economic justification for doing so in puget sound in 20062007 13741 animals were found entangled in derelict fishing gear 5073 were recovered alive and released 8668 were dead this is just the tip of the iceberg animals caught in nets decompose rapidly preliminary experiments suggest that animals found in derelict nets represent catches that have occurred within only 14 days total annual mortality may well be 25 times higher this death toll is certainly grizzly but is the economic cost of removing the gear justified to clean away this killing gear costs 4960 per acre for derelict nets and 193 per crab trap directly measurable monetized benefits of gear removal were based on the commeral value that spees killed in the gear would have had on the market this came out to 248 per trap annually and 6285 per acre of nets over a 10year period and presumes that all commeral spees found in derelict gear would have been caught in other ways with these assumptions noted the costbenefit ratio of removing this debris equals 13 10 for each gear type this estimate of monetary benefits is conservative because it includes only the commeral value of spees it does not include recreational and other values that might have been realized had not these animals been killed by derelict gear nor indirect benefits that may have accrued through improved ecosystem services this means that removing derelict gear makes sense for fish and wildlife and for the economy demonstrating these values is one goal of the marine and coastal keystone
