 this is the year during which new visions took root and began to grow increasingly we are working on a larger scale consistent with the need to ensure that protected lands and waters retain their ecological integrity because ecological systems rarely coinde with humandrawn boundaries we also are working across traditional geographic political and intellectual lines so too are we learning to make the most of our organizational and finanal strengths through relationships with partner organizations and more imaginative yet prudent use of the funds available to us at the core of these efforts is conservation by design a framework that draws upon our history and experience to identify those areas where we can concentrate our resources to greatest effect we have identified ecoregions around the globe where we know we can be true to our mission and we are seeing results that will stand the test of time two examples from among the many available demonstrate these successes in less than three years we have preserved more than a million acres of forests in the northeastern united states all part of a vast ecoregion that’s a very big number and one in which we can take pride had we not been first displined in identifying the areas of maximum impact for preserving biodiversity and then imaginative in the use of our resources i don’t think we could have orchestrated the many separate agreements that contributed to the million acres along the way we partnered with other conservation groups states the federal government timber investors and large lumber companies—all the while being true to sound conservation prinples halfway around the world in indonesia the vast forests of east kalimantan are part of another major ecoregion identified by our careful research part of what makes this region so critical is the presence of a large number of orangutans information we confirmed via a conservancy research team made up of us and indonesiabased staff this information gave new impetus to efforts by the local staff and usbased fundraisers and governmentrelations experts to coordinate with partners as diverse as indonesian offials the us agency for international development and home depot on projects to deter the illegal logging that is such a threat to the vast rain forests and their orangutan inhabitants
