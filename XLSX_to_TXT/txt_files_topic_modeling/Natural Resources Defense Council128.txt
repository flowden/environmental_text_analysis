 a few months ago i came to  to take on the job of a lifetime— leading the world’s most effective environmental group in the fight to protect our natural world and build a better future for us all at the same time our country was seating a new congress in the months since too many of its members have made it clear that they want to shred the bedrock environmental protections we’ve spent a generation putting in place too many have shown that they will put polluter profits first while putting the rest of us at risk right now polluters and their friends in washington dc are doing everything they can to stop our nation—and the world—from taking action against climate change they’re not concerned that fracking has brought the dangers of the industrial oil patch to our back yards they’re not concerned that oil trains are exploding in our downtowns and that pipelines are spewing crude into our rivers they’re not concerned that the pristine arctic ocean and the eastern seaboard are in the crosshairs of offshore drilling they’re not concerned that toxic chemicals threaten our water and food they are willing to mortgage our children’s future by keeping us dependent on the dirty habits of the past here’s the thing we’re not going to let them get away with it  was founded for just these kinds of challenges it’s why john adams helped create this institution 45 years ago it’s what we mastered under the leadership of frances beinecke it’s what i’m focused on every day as i take up the mantle they’ve passed on to me we know that for every challenge we face there are also incredible opportunities for progress think about what we’ve achieved together in just the last few months after years of fighting the keystone xl pipeline we’ve seen president obama veto legislation that would have forced some of the planet’s dirtiest oil through the breadbasket of america after the hottest year on record we’re seeing states move toward a clean energy future by cleaning up power plants—the singlebiggest step we’ve ever taken to cut carbon pollution and after decades of indesion we’re seeing us leadership build momentum for real global action against climate change when 196 nations gather in paris this fall this is the job of a lifetime not just for me but for all of us—the 24 million members and activists who believe in what  stands for and will do what it takes to advance this great mission i’m proud to walk forward with you
