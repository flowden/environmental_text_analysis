 dawone robinson regional director of s energy effiency for all project works to create opportunities for lowincome communities of color to save energy and money why are some communities unable to take advantage of energy effiency opportunities i think if you were to ask the average person to close their eyes and think about how we can deliver energy effiency programs to a family theyll picture mostly singlefamily home improvements like adding attic insulation or sealing ductwork this tendency to overlook residents of multifamily buildings is also true of policymakers and utilities these residents have little incentive to invest in long term energy effiency upgrades themselves and property owners often lack incentives as well espeally in cases where tenants pay their own energy bills this split incentive challenge is a barrier to progress the result is that lowincome households and renters are left behind how does this inequity impact energy costs we partnered with the american counl for an energyeffient economy to look at energy costs for families in the 50 largest ties in the united states and found that renters pay more for energy as a percentage of their income than homeowners do lowincome families pay more than your average family and people of color pay more than white households across the board even if you control for the size of the home so for the equivalent square footage people of color pay more lowincome families pay more renters pay more now why is that the reason is that quality of the housing stock these homes are generally leaky theyre older and rundown theyre ineffient so people are paying more money in homes that are less comfortable thats an injustice we need to help solve how is  helping to bridge this gap were still dealing with a huge disparity in the amount of resources that are actually going to the multifamily housing sector nevertheless we do have some cases where weve been able to work with utilities to provide a pretty large sum of money for lowerincome people and people in multifamily housing in virginia we worked directly with the largest utility dominion energy through a shareholder funded program to dedicate about 140 million over the course of 10 years for lowincome weatherization other upgrades and some bill paying assistance the majority of that money has gone to multifamily housing how can policymakers help address this disparity more than half of the nations states have mandatory energy effiency savings targets the state or the utilities have to save a certain percentage of energy every year through effiency measures but how much of those energy saving is being achieved in low income housing usually not much we need to have equityfirst energy polies that prioritize the needs of lowincome families of color who are hit the hardest thats number one on the federal level we need to fight to both preserve and increase funding to vital programs including the low lncome home energy assistance program and the weatherization assistance program these resources are funded back down to the states to go toward weatherization and other heating and cooling assistance for lowincome families and utility programs need to get more creative instead of thinking about renewable energy and energy effiency in a single box put energy effiency first theres a saying that the cheapest energy is the energy we dont use if we were just smarter about the way we used our current energy resourcesif our homes and our appliances were more effientthen we wouldnt need to build more power plants how do you hope to see the energy effiency for all project ramp up in the coming years we host a lot of energy equity forums some past events have been in columbus georgia detroit baltimore and norfolk virginia we use them to explain to community members why their energy bills are as high as they are and what they can do about it we offer people practical dly suggestions to make their home energy effient and to ensure that their home is healthy from making basic ceiling improvements to scrapping out old incandescent bulbs for lbd light bulbs weve even had utilities show up and do outreach about programs they offer thats been very successful and l hope to do more of those events weve built a lot of connection with local offials and with utilities we dont need to be adversarial with all utilities sometimes we can partner up connect people with the programs they need and just do good community service
