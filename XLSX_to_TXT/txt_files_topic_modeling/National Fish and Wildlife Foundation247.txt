 keystones are the backbone of ’s strategic plan the keystone philosophy is straightforward choose a limited number of conservation investments focus resources on them establish indicators for success learn by measuring progress and adapt strategies as necessary to succeed choosing among the hundreds of appealing conservation investment opportunities that come our way each year is no easy task you simply can’t invest in them all guided by our new sence  evaluation team we are developing a desionmaking matrix based on • conservation need • ’s capaty to move the needle for target spees • anllary benefits to people and the broader environment and • the cost effectiveness of the available investment opportunities at the onset we’re focusing on fish and wildlife spees most people identify with spees easily because they are recognizable representatives of the speal habitats we all work to conserve we’re choosing spees that are in great need of conservation help and are likely to respond to the scale of investments we are capable of making we highly consider investments also benefitting other wildlife and important environmental issues such as water storage or carbon sequestration to help us make these desions our sentists are pioneering new ways to measure the direct impact of our actions and investments through cost effectiveness analyses looking at cost effectiveness is not always popular in conservation it’s often been enough just to say “this land or habitat or spees is threatened therefore we should save it” yet that approach is blind to other potentially more important opportunities at every step we are asking potential grantees to tell us exactly how projects will help individual spees our sentists take that information and work with outside experts to determine whether a project is really “moving the needle” for a spees or whether those dollars would achieve a bigger return on investment through another project some projects we might have supported in the past won’t pass this test we are confident though that this new approach will increase the frequency of our conservation successes and those of our partners this upfront analysis is only part of the equation because success will be determined in part by our commitment to fund projects over multiyear periods we are forming new relationships with grantees—taking on a role more akin to that of a managing partner we’ll meet with potential partners before we invest construct a framework that outlines how our mutual outcome is best achieved and develop a business plan to ensure effective movement towards our desired targets along the way we’ll evaluate our investments and make midcourse adjustments on wall street a 50 success rate in choosing investments is considered outstanding and the best managers learn from failure we’ll do the same unsuccessful approaches to conservation won’t be considered defeats—they will instead help us redirect our efforts to better practices the keystone approach is a new era for —one that we believe will make a world of difference for our fish and wildlife
