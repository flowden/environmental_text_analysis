 more and more longterm conservation strategies require not just protecting what’s there but also bringing an ecosystem back to its more natural state staghorn coral was once one of the most abundant corals on caribbean and floridian reefs but is now listed as a threatened spees the conservancy is working to reverse that trend through a coral restoration project in which researchers are growing staghorn coral in underwater “nurseries” and using them to restore reefs damaged by bleaching hurricanes and disease ensuring that these corals can withstand new threats is another important piece of longterm conservation the florida reef resilience program brings together sentists reef managers and reefdependent industries to investigate what factors can infl uence a reef’s resilience and how to protect it ideas being tested here such as that some reefs are more resistant to coral bleaching than others can be traced almost directly back to the waters of palau there conservancy sentist rod salm noticed that corals were still alive beneath the shade of a rocky overhang while unshaded corals of the same spees were dead just meters away information gathered through the program is allowing the conservancy to propose reef management approaches that protect the most resilient corals which will repopulate and heal more vulnerable reefs
