 we live in a rapidly changing world a growing population that requires more food water and energy is stressing the very land rivers and oceans that sustain us a shifting global economy is moving production to farflung corners of the world with unforeseen environmental impact and a changing climate is threatening to undo much of the work  has accomplished over 65 years but change is not a oneway street we can change the ways we grow our food to be more productive on less land we can ensure water security by changing how water users invest in watershed conservation we can tap new technologies to change how we manage our fisheries and we can plant more trees to meet growing demand for timber while changing the trajectory of climate change we can make these changes while still remaining true to our commitment to care for nature and biodiversity  is an organization of pragmatic optimists where others see doom and gloom we see opportunity for innovation and positive change we’re not naive we know the challenges ahead are formidable but we also believe that by galvanizing all sectors of soety engaging more partners and thinking bigger than we ever have we can positively change the world so people and nature can thrive together over the past year i have seen the change we’ve nurtured at one place take hold and expand with a promise of global impact take the concept of water funds where we were first inspired by new york ty’s investment in the forests that produce and hold its drinking water we created a system in which downstream water users pay to implement upstream conservation projects in order to improve water quality and quantity the first successful test was in quito ecuador in 2000 since then we’ve created 24 water funds in nine countries mostly in latin america see page 22 building on our success in latin america we now have scores of additional projects in operation or development on four continents four funds are now up and running in the united states and the first in africa—serving 9 million people in nairobi kenya and guided by our china urban water blueprint our team is developing several water funds in china including one near the metropolis of hangzhou this past year we launched another inno vation with global promise in the seychelles a tropical nation of 115 islands in the indian ocean see page 44 like many island nations the seychelles is grappling with sealevel rise and heightened storms brought on by climate change in response the country is now investing a portion of its foreign debt into marine conservation and climate adaptation projects such as reef and mangrove restoration  used our sence legal and finanal expertise to make this pioneering effort possible naturevest ’s impact investing division brought together loans and grants to augment the seychelles’ debt restructuring this model will now serve other island nations around the world offering people both a resilient natural environment and an improved economic future the past year also saw milestones in our efforts to promote change within the agricul tural sector from the american heartland to the amazon basin we’re bringing together farmers academics governments and businesses in the agriculture and food industries together we’re promoting largescale sencebased practices that safeguard our waters and lands while empowering growers to meet the rising demand for food fuel and fiber and there’s another important benefit of this work these practices done right across a large area can sequester a large amount of carbon for example  is lending its sentific and technical expertise to a farmerdriven effort to change soil health practices in the american midwest we’re working with a network of demonstration farms that can increase produc tivity and store more carbon and water in the soils while also redung nutrient runoff into the great lakes and mississippi river—and ultimately the gulf of mexico and in brazil “deforestationfree” beef has entered the marketplace after years of work with ranchers retailers government agenes and other partners to reduce the impact of farming and ranching on amazon forests see page 21 this pilot effort in the brazilian state of pará is a leading example of the kind of deforestationfree supply chain that many consumer goods companies have committed to by 2020 replicated at scale this work has the potential to dramatically change the trajectory of deforestation and related carbon emissions across the amazon basin with decreased deforestation the amazon’s wildlife and indigenous communities can prosper as well we think these naturebased solutions will play a pivotal role in meeting the climate challenge at the same time we also continue to push hard for policy change in the us each of our 50 state chapters has a clear strategy to build broadbased support for climate action including cleanenergy policy in florida for example we supported a bipartisan ballot measure to incentivize private solar installations voters passed the measure with overwhelming support and in ohio we teamed up with the  to make the economic case for increasing renewable energy in a big win for cleanenergy jobs gov john r kasich vetoed legislation that would have discouraged energy investments in the state we’ve still got a long way to go but i’m proud of how we are drawing on one of our biggest strengths—bringing diverse groups together—to find practical commonground solutions to the climate challenge and finally this past year we also continued to apply ’s oldest strategy—land acquisition—to show that conservation and development can go hand in hand our purchase of fortin chacabuco in argentina to use as a demonstration ranch will not only protect important habitat but also inform sustainable grazing management across the expansive grasslands of patagonia see page 22 these and the other achievements that follow in this report are just a sampling of what  has done in the past year to demonstrate positive change in a world where change too often connotes decline and despair the hopeful change our achievements inspire is a result of the collaboration of sentists donors volunteers and partners we thank all of you sincerely what we all have in common is a deep and shared sense of compassion we care about other people far and near we care about all the world’s spees we care about future generations and the future of the earth together we can be the change we need to ensure a better world for all”
