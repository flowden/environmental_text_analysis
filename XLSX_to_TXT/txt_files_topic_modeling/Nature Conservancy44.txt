 for decades many of those dedicated to the protection of the natural world imagined conservation as an eternal tradeoff between people and nature farmers ranchers and corporations were the enemy despite our dependence on the products and services they provided and emphasis was on saving pieces of the places we love and fenng them off from people in truth we owe a great deal to those efforts but the reality we face today requires us to reimagine how we can safeguard the nature we love and depend upon from a burgeoning global population a growing middle class and forces like climate change  partnered with the university of minnesota and 11 other organizations to ask whether it is possible to achieve a future where both people and nature thrive the research paper “an attainable global vision for conservation and human wellbeing” published last year in frontiers in ecology and the environment presents a sentific test of our vision for a future where abundant healthy ecosystems and thriving human communities coexist to answer this question we compared what the world will look like in 2050 if economic and human development progress in a “business as usual” fashion and what it would look like if instead we join forces to implement a sustainable path applying existing solutions to the challenges that lie ahead these scenarios let us ask can we do better can we design a future that meets people’s needs without further degrading nature in the process our answer is yes but it comes with several big ifs there is a path to get there but matters are urgent—if we want to accomplish these goals by midcentury we’ll have to dramatically ramp up our efforts now the next decade is critical furthermore changing course in the next 10 years will require global collaboration on a scale not seen perhaps since world war ii the widely held impres sion that economic and environmental goals are mutually exclusive has contributed to a lack of connection among key soetal constituenes best equipped to solve interconnected problems—namely the public health development finanal and conservation communities this has to change the notion of development versus conservation is simply untrue over the past several years  has been actively engaged on all fronts to establish and refine a shared conservation agenda that addresses current and future realities and makes manifest a world where people and nature thrive together internally we see it as an evolution not a revolution we continue to rely upon and build from strategies and values that were there from the start many continue to see us as a large american land trust and indeed we continue to protect natural lands only now focusing on efforts of much larger scale and we have extended those protection strategies to rivers coasts and oceans but truth be told we were never just a onetrick pony early on we worked actively as a partner to governments and sought to influence policy in our areas of expertise we also successfully engaged the corporate sector four decades ago when others considered it anathema to conservation all along the benefit to human wellbeing of our work were an unspoken and unheralded byproduct it’s impossible to work hand in glove with landowners including farmers and ranchers whose livelihoods are inextricably linked to land protection without understanding the connection and as we expanded beyond the us first to latin america and the caribbean then to asiapafic and africa we recognized that in the developing world the union between people and nature is undeniable today we’ve moved that intrinsic relationship between people and nature to the forefront recognizing sentifically that time is running out to make the changes necessary to ensure that both can thrive how we grow our food and fish our oceans how we stabilize our climate and how we make our expanding ties more accommodating and dependent on nature’s services are as essential to our mission now as buying land was in the 1950s the pages that follow provide a taste of the many actions  is taking regionally to tackle the chal lenges that face nature and people in the 21st century from ensuring clean fresh water in africa to inspiring sustainable fisheries in the pafic from partnering with indigenous communities to secure more than a third of australia’s landmass to helping balkan nations safeguard europe’s last freeflowing rivers from restoring brazil’s atlantic forest to successfully lobbying the us congress to adequately fund wildfire control—these 2018 achievements are the tip of the iceberg in ’s coordinated efforts on five continents to help ensure a healthy natural world for people and nature we do this with the support of our members donors governments and corporate partners we do this with our fellow conservation and humanitarian ngos and with world state and community leaders we do this for wildlife for farmers ranchers and fishers for the communities of kenyan savannas and the densely populated ties of india we do it for our sons and daughters and generations to come we do this for the physical mental and emotional wellbeing that nature provides and inspires
