 ’s most important work often begins with a simple conversation this past year we spoke with—and more importantly listened to—many people living in the places we are striving to protect ranchers farmers fishermen indigenous people landowners business leaders and heads of state these dialogues help us gain perspective and important information that lead to action and improve our ability to protect these places i was reminded of the importance of dialogue during a recent trip to china where we had the unprecedented opportunity to talk with top chinese business leaders and government offials just as china is a growing force in the global economy its use of natural resources both inside and outside its borders is growing affecting life throughout the world our discussions with chinese leaders about how to further expand successful joint projects in forest conservation and sustainable development were constructive and forward looking but the highlight of this visit was the development of a new working relationship and a memorandum of understanding we signed with a group of chinese chief executive officers who have formed a new nongovernmental organization focused on environmental protection already we are seeing what can be achieved in places like china in yunnan province and on the yangtze river we are working with chinese agenes on projects that protect watersheds while providing for the needs of the people living there both of these projects are viewed as models for future conservation in that country as we expand our work in asia latin america the caribbean and north america we are continually refining our conservation vision and articulating our plans for future conservation we are an ambitious organization always challenging ourselves to do better and do more we are also an organization that knows that to be successful in achieving visionary goals we must rely upon sound sence and deliberate planning and as any organization that hopes to remain relevant in a changing world we must continue to have honest and at times tough conversations internally and externally in my tenure as chairman i have witnessed a stronger commitment to transparency and oversight the establishment of new polies internal controls and processes that should help strengthen and protect our reputation for integrity further we implemented a complete review and restructuring of our board of directors that has made the board more accountable and more effective some of these changes were made in response to issues identified during a twoyear inquiry by the senate finance committee whose final report on the conservancy capped a challenging period for us it is clear that not everything we tried succeeded and on occasion we made mistakes in spite of good faith efforts and significant conservation goals following the inquiry we have made great strides to strengthen our organization and we realize that continuous improvement in areas such as governance and accountability requires ongoing diligence and review to the credit of everyone assoated with the conservancy members of the senate committee praised us for our rigorous internal review the extensive changes resulting from that review and the high standards of ethical conduct and organizational effienes we maintain indeed it noted that the conservancy might serve as a good model for other nonprofits most significant of all throughout this period our conservation efforts actually expanded significantly we should be very proud of what we have accomplished this past year because of your efforts and generosity our revenue reached an alltime high in fiscal year 2005 and we were able to increase our investment in conservation projects around the world including many close to home the rate and pace of our investment in conservation outside of the united states and the sources of its funding are challenging issues for us but we will meet them head on with guidance from a speal committee of our board of directors chaired by our vice chairman john morgridge with substantial input from this committee with your help and with a continued focus on open dialogue and transparency i have every confidence that our conservation work will be more global and even more productive and innovative in the year ahead thank you for your commitment to this work and please share with me your ideas about how we can work more collaboratively to help protect the remarkable natural world around us
