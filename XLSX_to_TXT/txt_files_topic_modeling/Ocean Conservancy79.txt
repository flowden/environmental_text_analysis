 the ocean drives and moderates our climate and provides much of the oxygen we breathe and the food we eat it is essential to our very survival—the lifesupport system for our planet earth however has warmed in the last 100 years by nearly a degree centigrade absorbing over 80 percent of the excess heat produced by the greenhouse effect a few degrees more of warming will devastate many coastal communities wipe out the world’s coral reefs and lead to mass extinctions of marine life we are no longer dealing with projections or ominous warnings about the future ocean climate change is now the fact remains that even if carbon emissions are substantially reduced ocean warming will continue for decades helping our ocean deal with the onslaught of climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our lifetime  is an acknowledged leader in raising awareness of the threats climate change poses to the ocean through cuttingedge advocacy and close collaboration with other leading conservation groups corporations and policy makers we are reshaping the polies this nation adopts as it attempts to come to grips with the sacrifices we will all be called upon to make in response to this serious crisis a new lens ocean climate change  stepped to the forefront of the conservation community in raising the call that the ocean must be a primary focus of efforts to mitigate climate change worldwide we are leading the charge for sencebased solutions aimed at helping the ocean adapt to environ mental changes that are now viewed as inevitable we inspired members to stay uptodate and involved in legislative activity on climate change and worked to ensure that critical ocean adaptation provisions were included in the senate climate change bill we also seized the opportunity to address the only annual conference of environmental journalists to seed with the media the important message that there is a deep and powerful connection between the ocean and our climate in the face of the greatest environmental challenge of our lifetime  will continue to raise public awareness of the plight of the ocean due to climate change and to promote sencebased solutions to the crisis speaking out on capitol hill at the urging of  the congressional committee devoted to combating climate change held its firstever hearing on the impact of global climate change on the ocean and espeally the effects climate change will have on coral reefs of the four people invited to speak two were from  we took the opportunity to raise awareness of the connection between the ocean and our everyday lives president and ceo vikki spruill testified that “the ocean is where the rubber hits the road with climate change” board member and worldrenowned oceanographer sylvia earle joined vikki in testifying emphasis on the arctic the arctic is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet rapidly melting ice has opened the arctic to the potential for abuse oil drilling international ship ping and industrial fishing operations are competing to grab these newly exposed areas  is uniquely positioned to collaborate with local governments subsistencereliant communities and conservation partners to confront the threats of climate change in this important but fragile region by reestablishing our alaska office in 2008  asserted its regional expertise our sentists and policy experts began aggressively calling for a timeout on rapid commeral expansion in the arctic until we have the sence and the structure we need to guide desionmaking the polies and protections we put in place in the region will serve as models as we address changes farther south clean air clean consence  and several leading community and conservation partners joined an innovative petition to the environmental protection agency to protect the arctic through immediate and comprehensive regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act currently that law is the only mechanism under which a federal agency can regulate greenhouse gasses through the petition  demanded that the united states accept legal and moral responsibility to protect the arctic region in the interest of public health and welfare the petition presented a clear and persuasive sentific explanation of the effects of climate change on the arctic and the ways those changes are now affecting the rest of the united states and the world the epa has since asked president obama for his okay to take the requested action and raised with him the threat to public health and welfare drilling on the outer continental shelf  believes that faster cheaper safer options exist to solve the energy crisis cut individual energy bills and quickly reduce america’s dependence on foreign oil in 2008 we worked to maintain opposition to the call for new drilling off our coastlines in the face of the considerable political pressure and public cries to “drill baby drill” when it became clear that the 27year moratorium on new drilling no longer had the necessary political support  was at the table to craft a compromise  remains proactive on capitol hill to advocate a balanced sustainable energy approach while helping to ensure that any future legislative expansion of drilling includes adequate measures to counter the adverse environmental impacts of such exploration
