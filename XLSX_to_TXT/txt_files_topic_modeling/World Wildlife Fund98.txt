 i recently read the 10year conservation strategy plan from ’s program office in mexico and was blown away i was reminded of the power of local voices the central importance of place and the fact that one of ’s most valuable assets is the authentity of our local programs around the world for my mexican colleagues the center of gravity in their work is the role of nature in helping people lift their families out of poverty although just 3 of mexico’s population lives below the strictly defined international poverty line—earning less than 190 per day according to the world bank—42 live with at least some degree of poverty and lack access to adequate water food shelter and education the mexican agrarian practice of designating ejidos—swaths of communal land within which tizens individually farm spefic parcels—was conceived as a response to the peasant landlessness that contributed to the outbreak of the mexican revolution but a combination of factors including small parcel size corruption and low yield means that most ejidatarios cannot make a living that sustains their family i usually write about the global issues we face but reading mexico’s strategy document inspired me to think more deeply about the role of nature in the american experience and to consider the part the united states plays in solving the greatest environmental problems of our day in both cases the role of our country and the fate of the world are inextricably bound up with each other diversity of nature from native communities to farmers and fishers to cowboys and early industrialists our histories have emerged from the lands and waters that surround us nature is embedded indelibly in the lives of americans native american cultures rest on a reverence for nature that is the stuff of legend immortalized in the totem poles of the pafic northwest the creation stories of the oglala sioux and a speech delivered by chief seattle of the squamish tribe in 1854 “every part of this country is sacred to my people” the sweeping landscapes painted by bierstadt and moran the iconic yosemite valley images of ansel adams and the words of john muir henry david thoreau rachel carson and aldo leopold all convey the majesty of nature and its power to change our lives the united states established the world’s first national park and some of the world’s strongest environmental legislation to support clean water clean air and endangered spees yellowstone and yosemite the volcanos of hawaii and the pulsing currents of the hudson are our versions of europe’s cathedrals they reveal truths about our history as a country and what we choose to value and they are the places and sounds that connect us all to something greater than ourselves diversity of people drawn by a sense of possibility people from all over the world have come to the united states for more than two centuries to learn seek jobs and recreate their lives our famous meltingpot soety brings its own tensions—but also contributes to a stew of innovation that has made a measurable difference in the world • education the us is home to more colleges and universities than any country except india the first college in the world chartered to grant degrees to women—wesleyan college in macon georgia—was founded in 1836 international students account for more than 5 of highereducation enrollment • commerce our economy remains among the strongest in the world of the 500 largest companies in the world 46 are based in the us • innovation us inventors account for more than half of the worldwide patents generated in the last 40 years of the 50 innovations that “have done the most to shape the nature of modern life” according to the atlantic magazine 34 are american in origin they include electrity the internet the telegraph anesthesia and the combine harvester but as many are quick to point out the outsized american imprint on the world is not all positive the us uses onethird of the world’s paper and a quarter of the world’s oil although we represent less than 5 of the global population by the measure of ’s living planet report we consume per capita 10 times the global average the dissemination of our culture of consumerism does not bode well for the planet and as we are increasingly aware extraordinary economic growth has been accompanied by growing income inequality contributing to disruptions in our political system at home and so our work rests on navigating these two facets of our national footprint bringing our best talents to the world and setting a stronger example in driving sustainable living in the united states our current president stunned the world last june by signaling his intention to withdraw from the paris agreement our response was to lean hard into the diversity of our country we got busy working with others to make sure the world knows that america’s tradition of problemsolving remains very much intact we know our country is much more than the actions of any single individual even when that individual occupies the white house we listened closely to our partners and supporters who voiced their ongoing commitment to the paris agreement and we responded by working with mayor bloomberg ceres climate nexus and others to give them a platform to make their voices heard we are still in an impressive and powerful coalition declaring its continued support of climate action to deliver on the paris agreement members of the we are still in coalition include • 2500 governors mayors businesses universities native american tribes and faith communities— representing 130 million americans and a combined 62 trillion in gdp 1⁄3 of the us economy • 1780 businesses and investors including 35 fortune 500 companies representing 48 million us employees and 23 trillion in total annual revenue the we are still in coalition represents what  does best respond to global challenges and drive practical solutions to the same build and catalyze partnerships that create momentum and help tip the world toward sustainability you see that approach in our work on the largest tropical forest conservation program in history arpa for life we helped create and finance parks—128 million i know our country will continue playing a leadership role in the protection of the global environment— helping other countries secure their natural resources has enormous relevance in the us acres in the brazilian amazon—and are now defending some of those parks against attempts to open them up to agriculture and mining consider the collaboration between the us and canada to protect large swaths of the arctic from oil and gas drilling or our engagement with the us and china on ending the ivory trade which established a spirit of cooperation between the two countries that carried over to their support for the landmark paris agreement on climate change think about our approach in project gigaton a partnership with the world’s largest company walmart and hundreds of its suppliers to remove one gigaton of greenhouse gases from the company’s supply chain by 2020 no matter which way the political winds blow i know our country will continue playing a leadership role in the protection of the global environment—because we know that helping other countries secure their natural resources has enormous relevance in the us and we know that we must work harder to set a sustainable example here at home all of this requires us to imagine inventions polies businesses and lifestyles that are not just good for the bottom line but also good for the planet—the only one we have our home today more than ever the world expects no less
