 it’s been a rollercoaster year for bombus affinis aka the rusty patched bumblebee on march 21 this small and mighty pollinator became the firstever bumblebee spees to receive endangered spees act protections and with no time to waste the bee has lost 90 percent of its habitat in the past 20 years and has seen its populations decline by 87 percent since the late 1990s but adding to the bee’s troubled fate the trump team made a desion shortly after taking office to freeze the endangered spees listing—part of the administration’s “immediate regulatory freeze” knowing this move was illegal and that it would almost certainly spell extinction for the rusty patched bumblebee  filed suit and thanks in no small part to the 130000 people who petitioned the us fish and wildlife service fws we won one of our first victories against the environmentally destructive polies of the trump administration it was a small but important step in the fight to protect native bees—essential spees to our food security and the health of our ecosystems— and a move that helped lay the groundwork to protect endangered bees and butterflies across 28 states from the soaring use of neonic pestides that are killing pollinators the numbers speak for themselves—some 33 percent of honeybee colonies collapsed between april 2016 and march 2017 with the chemical industry’s growing influence on the us environmental protection agency’s epa agenda—several former industry executives now directly oversee the agency’s toxics office—the problem has grown only worse by continuing to allow products containing toxic chemicals to enter the market and failing to consult with fws on the insectides’ impact on threatened or endangered spees the epa is violating the federal endangered spees act in response  filed a second pollinatortargeted federal lawsuit in october seeking to cancel the registrations of nearly 100 products containing three widely used neonic pestides— acetamiprid dinotefuran and imidacloprid— until the epa complies with the law “the epa ignored endangered bees butterflies and birds when it approved the widespread use of neonics” says rebecca riley a senior attorney in ’s nature program “massive pollinator dieoffs across the country show that these pestides cause serious harm” twentysix spees listed under the endangered spees act are at risk from neonic pestides in addition to the rusty patched bumblebee they include the karner blue butterfly hines’ emerald dragonfly blackcapped vireo and pallid sturgeon as well as the federally threatened vernal pool fairy shrimp  is urging swift action from the epa with added pressure from our three million members and activists “it’s time for the agency to do its job and make sure our most vulnerable spees are protected from the products it approves” riley says
