 imagine a chemical company set up shop in perspective think of this a single teaspoon an independent study that would determine along the banks of one of maines most of mercury a potent neurotoxin espeally just how much mercury it had discharged into beautiful and mightiest rivers the largest hazardous to children and pregnant women the river and to what extent that pollution estuary in all of new england imagine that could contaminate enough 6sh to fill an entire had affected local wildlife and public health plant starts dumping toxic mercury directly railroad car mallinckrodt appealed and an appellate court into those waters and continues to do so for in 2000  and the maine peoples upheld the ruling well over a decade alliance a tizens group brought a joint a group of sentists spent nine years now imagine the people who live lawsuit against mallinckrodt conducting the investigation and the results in downstream from that plant are completely the alliance had been organized around their 2013 report were damning the penobscot unaware of this dangerous pollution so they the issue for years before  came on contained at least nine metric tons of mercury continue to catch sell and eat lobsters and board but it had been missing one critical with concentrations in sediment 10 to 20 crabs from those waters without any idea of tool lawyers they had everything except times higher than in other maine rivers in one the health risks involved litigation says nancy marks a senior section of the river the level of toxic mercury thats just what happened after mallinckrodt attorney at  who has worked on the case in lobster tails was found to be 25 times opened a plant in orrington maine in 1967 from the beginning  it was a perfect match higher than what maine deems safe for human to produce chlorine bleach for the states a perfect match indeed after two years consumption songbirds in a marsh adjacent paper mills from that year until about 1982 in court a federal judge found mallinckrodt to the river channel also had blood mercury the fality discharged up to 12 metric tons of responsible for the mercury contamination concentrations higher than any recorded in the mercury into the penobscot river to put that he ordered the company to foot the bill for sentific literature kenneth wyman has been fishing for marks also pointed out that this was a cue lobsters and crabs for 27 years from his home about corporate responsibility mallinckrodt in stockton springs 20 miles downstream made a profit while poisoning the penobscot from orrington he had no idea the river was with mercury endangering public health and polluted with mercury until the state closed the environment she said for over forty the fishery l was sickened to the core he years the burdens of that contamination said in court testimony i dont know that have been borne by maine communities both much about mercury other than it is a poison federal law and prinples of fairness demand and ive been feeding it to the general public that mallinckrodt shoulder the burden now for to tens of thousands of people for 25plus cleaning up its pollution the judge agreed years that included his pregnant daughter on september 2 2015 acknowledging that the inlaw without intervention the sentists penobscot continues to suffer irreparable harm estimated it would take more than six decades from mercury contamination he ordered the for the mercury to drop to levels that werent company to take steps to clean up its mess once hazardous to humans or wildlife and for all perhaps unsurprisingly mallinckrodt engineers must now determine the best balked at the panels findings and spent possible method for getting rid of the mercury millions of dollars disputing the sence doing at mallinckrodts expense if the engineers find a whatever it could to continue to avoid taking way then  and the maine peoples alliance responsibility for its toxic mess following will go back to court a final time to try to force the state of maines desion to put seven the corporate polluter to make things right square miles of the lower penobscot off limits this monumental victory is a story of true limits to lobster and crab fishing as a result community justice it holds the promise of of the reports contamination findings  protecting the health of countless people and the maine peoples alliance returned to preserving maines lobstering and fishing federal court the goal was straightforward economy and restoring an ecosystem spanning force mallinckrodt to clean up its pollution more than 20 miles in and along the river if a cleanup is viable none of this would be happeningthe fact  the cleanup is for the people who look to that the river is polluted with mercury would the river for healthy food for their livelihood not even be known if it werent for this case for recreation and for spiritual sustenance and for the tizens who took up the fight said marks in a pretrial statement the says mitch bernard s founding director cleanup is also for the imperiled birds fish of litigation and current chief operating and wildlife that populate the rivers shores officer bernard also notes that this case is a and waters demonstration of s tenaty and values no other organization would devote the resources and have the endurance to stick it out weve been at this for 15 years and counting and were going to persist until the polluter is held fully accountable the river does not belong to a private company it belongs to the people of maine that is what were fighting for did you know when nroc opened its doors in 1970 it was americas first nonprofit dedicated to taking dirty industries to court in those early days there were few us lawyers suing pollutersand even fewer environmental laws on the books  changed all that by helping pass the clean water act and other bedrock environmental statutes over the last 45 years  litigators have taken on formidable adversaries including the us navy big oil companies and chemical manufacturers these cases often take years to win but  stays the course because of whats at stake  shielding people from things like cancer causing pollution and giving them a fighting chance against deep pocketed industries as mitch bernard the founding director of s litigation team says a little bit of justice us a beautiful thing
