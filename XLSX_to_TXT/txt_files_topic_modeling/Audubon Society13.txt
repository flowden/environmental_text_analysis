 international 1 panama defending a hotspot with the fastestgrowing economy in latin america panama faces intense development pressures these are espeally strong along the bay of panama below southeast of panama ty the bay’s rich vibrant mangrove forests and coastal wetlands comprise one of the most important shorebird migration sites in the western hemisphere millions of birds— including more than 30 percent of the global population of western sandpipers along with large numbers of other priority central and pafic spees like the semipalmated plover the wilson’s plover and the whimbrel—rely on the bay’s extensive mudflats to rest and refuel during migration in april in response to a legal challenge by developers a panamanian court suspended the bay’s status as a conservation wildlife refuge opening the door to the ty’s expansion into this fragile ecosystem all of which magnifies the importance of audubon’s work with the panama  to help government business leaders and local residents understand the bay’s many benefits and protect its vital habitats for birds 3 tiny ambassadors for conservation lucky residents of arizona enjoy the country’s highest diversity of hummingbird spees—but the state also has the largest number of spees at risk hummingbirds perform an essential function as pollinators for a wide array of native plants and because many migrate long distances— some from mexico all the way to southern canada— they promote genetic diversity among plants along their routes as some of the avian world’s most persuasive ambassadors hummingbirds are also a compelling focus for communitybased conservation audubon arizona’s urban hummingbird project introduces ty dwellers to wildlife observing and encourages them to take conservation actions like planting native spees that help a broad range of wildlife partipants not only make their backyards hummingbirdfriendly they monitor the birds their plantings attract and provide important data to researchers states 2 restoring health to new mexico’s rivers more than half of new mexico’s rivers have had their flows significantly altered by development and shortsighted water management says a recent audubon new mexico report the resulting loss of riparian forests threatens priority spees like the yellowbilled cuckoo and the southwestern willow flycatcher while riparian habitat accounts for only one percent of new mexico it is essential to 80 percent of its vertebrate spees renews the water supply for two million new mexicans and is vital to the tourism industry river sites encompass twothirds of the state’s important bird areas providing critical breeding and wintering habitat during migration the audubon new mexico report based on data from the epa and incorporating input from other conservation groups as well as tourism business owners recommends voluntary water management practices to restore river flows audubon’s strategy to address water management throughout the central flyway includes sencebased policy recommendations that integrate environmental concerns into regional water management one piece of the effort which is part of audubon’s western rivers initiative will restore up to 30 sites on the rio grande in new mexico and west texas audubon will work with elected offials water utilities and irrigators to reform water policy in the state 4 protecting texas waterbirds the thousands of waterbirds that rely on texas’s coastal beaches and wetlands include such priority spees as roseate spoonbills brown pelicans and reddish egrets the barrier islands that dot the coast from south texas to louisiana provide espeally important nesting wintering and stopover habitat that’s why audubon has been at the forefront of texas coastal island conservation for more than a century today audubon texas protects a network of 177 waterbird colonies encompassing close to 70 percent of the colonial waterbird islands on the texas coast including the world’s largest colony of reddish egrets and under audubon’s strategic plan the state program is expanding its waterbird initiative by rigorously monitoring birds and their habitat and working with other conservation partners to establish the state’s first coastwide waterbird rookery management plan chapters 5 healthy habitat for birds and people tucson’s arid landscapes support diverse and abundant wildlife with nearly 350 bird spees counted in the greater metropolitan area since 2000 partipants in the tucson bird count administered by tucson audubon tas and the university of arizona have recorded such charismatic birds as harris’s hawks broadbilled hummingbirds phainopeplas and pyrrhuloxias tas has been developing a series of demonstration projects with communities to bring life back to dry urban developments making them more sustainable healthy and inviting—for birds and people alike by building rainwaterharvesting systems chapter members help native and heritage plants thrive and provide shelter food and nesting opportunities for birds while providing food shade and other quality oflife improvements for people tas is working with the university of arizona to develop repe cards which tell people what combination of features will attract a particular spees to their yard and with chapters across the state to create a southwestern backyard habitat recognition program what audubon learns in tucson will spur conservation success in more communities throughout arizona and beyond friends 6 anne durning laveen arizona she’s been to africa central and south america and the arctic but it was on a trip to audubon’s hog island in maine that anne durning’s love of birds blossomed an audubon member since 1986 an audubon chapter leader and an audubon arizona board member since 2009 durning has a passion for birds and for travel “i like audubon first and foremost because i like birds” she says “protecting their habitat is so very important being out in a beautiful location and sitting quietly while watching and listening to all the birds and other creatures can be mystical” one of her favorite local spots is the nina mason pulliam rio salado audubon center in phoenix where urban kids and adults can experience na ture there people learn about how their actions affect the surrounding environment and what they can do to improve bird habitats in their own backyards “it’s something each one of us can do in our own lives and try to inspire others to do it as well” she says centers 7 nebraskas migration superhighway each spring nebraska’s platte river is the site of one of north america’s true wildlife spectacles the migration of sandhill cranes more than a halfmillion of the cranes along with threatened piping plovers and endangered whooping cranes and least terns rely on the river’s wetlands and sandbars to prepare for a migratory push that can take them to the arctic at the center of this singular phenomenon is audubon nebraska’s iain nicolson audubon center and no place offers a better introduction to the miracle of migration—or a better demonstration of the importance of platte river habitat now just a tenth of its historic ex panse for the staff at audubon’s rowe sanctuary an important bird area that surrounds the center conservation is a yearround commitment that includes clearing river channels building least tern and piping plover nesting islands and restor ing wetlands vegetation to assure a future for america’s greatest migration the nicolson center is engaging people worldwide in personal experiences with the cranes this spring the audubon center had more than 13000 guests from 48 different countries and all 50 states the rowe staff and volunteers provided 194 guided programs for 4400 guests in six weeks and volunteers donated more than 4600 hours in that time
