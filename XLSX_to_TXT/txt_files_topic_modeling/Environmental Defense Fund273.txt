 rob seitz was 15 when he first went to sea with his grandfather longlining for halibut at cook inlet alaska “fishing is what i’ve always wanted to do” he says over the years seitz encountered many dangers like the time he nearly capsized after catching a navy submarine in his net but it wasn’t danger that nearly drove him off the water in 2002 seitz who now operates a trawler out of morro bay california almost quit in the face of plummeting fish prices and ineffective regulation the pafic groundfish catch fell 70 over two decades “fishermen were going broke” he says “and port falities were closing” on the west coast—as elsewhere—fishery managers had tried to end overfishing by shortening the season which only compelled fishermen to catch as many fish as possible as quickly as possible even in dangerous weather more than ten million pounds of fish were wasted annually about onefifth of the catch why because the rules had the perverse effect of forng fishermen to throw otherwise marketable fish overboard dead or dying  proposed a different approach called catch shares where each fisherman is assigned a percentage of a sentifically determined total allowable annual catch no longer rang against the clock fishermen can fish when it’s safe and market prices are high in 2011 the pafic fishery management counl started a catch share program which  helped design for 74 bottomdwelling spees known as groundfish observers are required on all boats and if a captain catches more than his share he can buy shares from another boat ensuring that the total allowable catch is not exceeded the result after just one year the amount of wasted fish has fallen 78 revenues are up and fish stocks are rebuilding “under the old system we were basically sharecroppers” seitz says “regulators set rules and we’d figure out how to get around them now we’re rewarded for good behavior it’s a much better system” today 65 of the fish caught in us waters are under catch share management  is now helping to expand the approach to global fisheries catch shares says shems jud ’s deputy west coast fisheries director have led to a boom in innovation as fishermen modify their gear to reduce impact on habitat and form cooperatives to promote conservation rather than fighting against marine protected areas many are now putting this conservation tool into action on their own without government intervention “when you get the incentives right” says jud “and unleash fishermen’s creativity to solve problems remarkable things happen”
