 at times it seems the environmental movement reduces itself to numbers and prices and markets and other measures of success or the lack thereof i know the saying goes that if we can’t measure something we won’t be able to save it and while numbers can certainly be inspirational i’d argue that the truth is more nuanced than that make no mistake i am absolutely devoted to delivering results that last at a scale commensurate with the challenges we are fang but i also love the words and imagery that motivate so many of us who have made conservation our life’s work—from muir to matthiessen from carson and stegner to bierstadt cousteau and ansel adams because the sublime beauty and genius of creation or evolution exceeds our grasp inspires and humbles us and reminds us that we cannot afford to lead our lives in a way that ravages the planet and drives other spees to extinction side by side with the poetry of our work and the beauty of the planet we seek to save our work is existential we all want to leave something behind after we’re gone but it is important to be honest with ourselves about the real difference we’re making for the planet are we changing the trends that are leading to the planet’s destruction are we building movements that lead to people consuming less produng more voting differently in a way that positively impacts the planet we all share those results often—but not always—can be measured by numbers and as i’ve said numbers can be inspirational whether that’s acres protected or parts per million of co2 in the air or the increased population of fish in the ocean or the number of tigers that still remain in the wild and we sometimes get far away from that kind of spefity in the language we use to talk about our work but if we are to honor the trust that our donors and investors put in us and make a real difference with the gift of their hardwon money we must hold ourselves accountable in this regard conservation does not yield results within anything resembling a predictable time frame but there are those moments when things come together at a scale that matters on those occasions you can mark the date and you can measure the impact in a way that is unequivocal luckily the world has seen many such events for example the setaside in 1872 of 2219776 acres in montana wyoming and idaho as yellowstone national park—the world’s first national park that audaous act not only preserved a landscape that lives large in the hearts and minds of americans it also created a movement that quickly became global now there are nearly 7000 national parks in more than 100 countries around the world it’s also hard to argue with the scale of the wilderness act passed in 1964 the legislation created a way to designate “wilderness areas” which are still the nation’s highest form of land protection the act also created the national wilderness preservation system as a means of managing these pristine wildlands and placed an inaugural 91 million acres into its care today the wilderness system protects nearly 110 million acres across the country it was these measurable conservation successes that helped make the following numbers possible protected areas now cover more than 154 of the world’s land area and 34 of the global ocean area every country in the world has some form of protected area system and these protected areas—categorized as national parks wilderness areas strict nature reserves and more—are the gifts that keep on giving they store 15 of the global terrestrial carbon stock help reduce deforestation and habitat and spees loss and support the livelihoods of over 1 billion people but in order to ensure these lands are permanently protected we need more than just a listing on a piece of paper that’s why  and our partners use a funding approach called project finance for permanence pfp that is all about the numbers the pfp method takes a meticulous sentific finanal and quantifiable approach to securing permanent and full funding for protected areas or networks of protected areas and ensuring their longterm finanal stability  first used the pfp approach in brazil where we joined public and private entities to raise 215 million to create consolidate and maintain the country’s 150 millionacre network of 114 protected areas the network called the amazon region protected areas program is almost three times larger than all us national parks combined and represents 15 of the brazilian amazon now  is testing the pfp approach in a number of the world’s most important conservation areas with an initial focus on largescale areas most of which are dominated by forests our current pfp work includes projects in peru bhutan and colombia taken together the pfp work in peru colombia and brazil could protect 15 of the entire amazon biome we’re exploring how to translate that approach—and our work quantifying the natural and economic value of ecosystems—in the arctic as well and there are also important numbers like this nearly a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions are the result of agriculture but people have to eat so what’s the answer  believes our commodity certification programs go a long way in creating a solution that works for the environment for communities and for businesses seventeen percent of global palm oil is certified by the roundtable on sustainable palm oil close to 10 of the annual global harvest of wildcapture fisheries is certified by the marine stewardship counl and more than 400 million acres—or approximately 10 of the world’s working forests—meet forest stewardship counl standards  helped create all three of these certification programs and plays a key role in supporting them to this day these measures matter and they represent the best work that we do there are other measures that delve more deeply into the profound connection between people and nature— none more so than the 17 sustainable development goals sdgs which all 193 un member states formally agreed to support last fall the sdgs are particularly significant because for the first time the un’s global development goals link the health of people to a thriving environment and later that fall at the paris climate talks many of the same nations that endorsed the sdgs also committed to hold global warming to well below 2°c above preindustrial levels and to pursue strategies to reach only a 15°c increase these global commitments are far from perfect but their success is fundamental to the future of humanity and the world and so  has embraced them as the major frame for our work because our conviction is that it’s not only about  and our own goals as important as they are and as strongly as we believe in them a safe and sustainable future is about how we help the world reach the bold goals it has set for itself earlier this year i received an email from a friend who asked “how do you drive an organization focused on impacts results and increased performance if you don’t organize your flagship reporting and communications around those impacts and results” the first answer is that we select goals that are important to our organization and to the world at large the second is that we connect those goals to the biggest initiatives we undertake—so we know we are pursuing initiatives at a scale that matters and that also allows us to hold ourselves accountable to progress and performance in communities around the world doing so requires us to construct our initiatives so we can measure their soal and ecological impacts in the same way that businesses measure market share or hospitals measure improvements in human health and with our chief sentist rebecca shaw and others throughout  we are developing a protocol that compels us to measure our contribution to these targets embraced by the world we are choosing projects and priorities more shrewdly and increasingly taking stock of our progress using meaningful indicators and on the basis of that information we are committed to remaining nimble so we can coursecorrect as needed if we find ourselves offtrack the truth is there are many things we cherish that cannot be measured but we know the world safeguards those things that it values and invests in those things that convinngly make a difference at  we are working stubbornly toward a time when our shared responsibility to nature is crystal clear and our collective stewardship of the planet exceeds the burden we place upon it and as always we are holding ourselves strictly accountable—not only to nature but also to you the paris agreement after weeks of negotiations at the un framework convention on climate change in paris 196 nations signed on to a historic plan to curb climate change and limit global temperature increases to 2°c above preindustrial levels and aim for only 15°c china and the us the two largest emitters of carbon pollution in the world made significant pledges china will peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and the us will cut greenhouse gases by 26–28 by 2025 both nations also formally agreed to the deal struck in paris building momentum for the agreement’s early entry into force on october 4 2016 food for the future we have long known that we cannot succeed in our mission unless we solve the interconnected threats of climate change and unsustainable food production so it was a true tipping point when the gordon and betty moore foundation announced more than 90 million in grants designed to decouple food production from negative environmental impacts the moore foundation allocated 191 million over two years to ’s work on the new conservation and finanal markets initiative and the collaboration for forests and agriculture and has also formed a seafood collaboration that will include  illegal fishing up to onethird of wildcaught seafood imported by the us may be illegal—and globally 85 of fish stocks are at risk from illegal fishing  presented a petition to the obama administration signed by more than 200000 us tizens urging action to end illegal fishing for all spees of fish worldwide and helping to elevate the profile of this important environmental and economic issue the renewable energy buyers alliance  is one of four nonprofit partners behind reba a consortium that works to grow—and help satisfy—corporate demand for renewable energy so far the power of reba has resulted in corporate contracts that will produce over six gigawatts gws of new renewable energy in the us we are wellpositioned to meet our goal of 25 gws of corporate renewable energy deployment by 2020 and to expand reba internationally tigers  and the global tiger forum announced that after six years of concentrated and collective effort the estimated number of wild tigers has increased for the first time in more than 100 years approximately 3890 tigers now exist in the wild an increase on the 2010 estimate of as few as 3200 the improved numbers are attributed to rising tiger populations in india russia nepal and bhutan enhanced protection in many tiger range countries and improved means of tracking and counting tigers in the wild sustainable development goals for the first time the un sustainable development goals recognized the link between freshwater and its role in improving human health for more than a year  pushed to secure a dedicated and comprehensive goal that included clean water and sanitation securing this language in the sdgs opens the door for a deeper engagement between  and the development community and overtly links the wellbeing of people to the ecological health of rivers where they live apple in april  collaborated with apple on apps for earth a 10day global causemarketing and awareness building campaign connected to earth day that involved the developers of 27 apps—including some of the most popular in the world the campaign was wildly successful it resulted in more than 3 billion potential impressions on twitter alone and our  together app which is available on both tablet and mobile phone was downloaded by nearly 400000 new viewers so as this year comes to a close i ask you to think about not only what we love but also what we can measure how many acres are protected how much has the world’s temperature risen how many tigers can we find in the wild how much of the ocean remains healthy and intact are we redung levels of poverty and hunger because the world has come together and set us on a path that if followed with conviction and determination could make the difference between outcomes that will inspire us and consequences that will break our hearts
