 technology and innovation have long been a part of ’s work in 1973  granted 38000 to the smithsonian institution to study the tiger population of nepal’s chitwan national park allowing sentists to successfully use radio tracking devices for the first time this represented cuttingedge technology when it happened and was celebrated as such today we use camera traps to record tiger—and elephant and rhino and more—movements and the data collected informs nationwide tiger censuses in nepal bhutan and elsewhere the early innovation used in chitwan led to the systems that today allow us to move closer to our goal of doubling the number of wild tigers by 2022 in a 1984 new york times editorial  vice president dr thomas e lovejoy set forth the concept of “debtfornature swaps”—trading debt reduction in developing countries for their protection of the environment it was an innovative idea that quickly caught on and persists today more than 26 billion in debt has been restructured through debtfornature swaps resulting in upwards of 12 billion in conservation funding globally google is one of our key tech partners several years ago we received 5 million through their global impact award program through this grant google sought to encourage us to adopt a more fastmoving prototyping entrepreneurial approach to solving a vexing problem at hand—in this case wildlife crime this sparked trial and error and experimentation and freed us from the stress of finding the perfect solution within a tight window of time lest we lose muchneeded support it also encouraged the spread of the same mindset in our work we used the grant to fund the wildlife crime technology project a platform to create and test innovative technologies aimed at changing the course of the global fight against wildlife crime while an initial focus was on piloting the use and integration of several technologies including drones in namibia it became clear following the project’s initial phase that we needed to adapt our approach we pivoted from a topdown technologydriven approach to a bottomup problemdriven approach that led to the serial testing evolution and adaptation of different solutions to the poaching crisis at  we now plan iterate and catalyze change just like breathing air and always in collaboration with our partners on the ground and since so much of what we do involves working with communities around the world—from the amazon to the irrawaddy delta—to secure or develop the tools they need to save landscapes and spees and improve livelihoods we build our technological innovations in collaboration with end users—from the field to the lab from the ground up perhaps the most important lesson we’ve learned over the decades of incorporating technology into our work is not to fall in love with technology for technology’s sake flashy is interesting but not always sustainable any technology we consider for use on the ground must be durable enough simple enough effective enough and repairable enough to make a realworld difference after all a farmer in a remote village in madagascar isn’t likely to be able to fund or find exotic technological components to make a rapidly needed fix that’s true even today in a world tom friedman described over a decade ago as “flat” because rapid advances in technology and communication were connecting people in a whole new way today the world is only getting flatter and this increasing connectedness has its challenges and its advantages one of the advantages is that people have greater access to tools that can improve their economic potential in friedman’s own words “when the world is flat you can innovate” from anywhere but among the many challenges these technologies can make it easier for others to exploit and deplete the planet’s finite supply of natural resources for example by selling elephant ivory and tiger parts online and thereby driving demand and further threatening alreadyfragile spees populations there are so many forces in the world using technology and innovation toward other ends—for profit illegal and otherwise for power for market share it’s time that we were just as fast and skilled and competent in deploying those same tools to keep intact the planet and the resources upon which we all depend as conservationists we are getting better at putting challenges on the table with the many technology partners that we have and engaging their talented teams in conceiving and deploying technology and innovation to match the scale of change in the world around us to outrun and outsmart the poachers to help inform and adapt the supply chains of the world’s largest companies to work with governments at every level to monitor their countries’ preous biodiversity and to link outcomes and investments to protect their natural resources a flat world means that in just eight weeks we can collect 270000 signatures in support of the endangered spees act a flat world means that through the power of the global  network we can let more than 5 million supporters around the world know that we are still all in on climate action—and we need them to join us a flat world means we can test blockchain machine learning soal media and monitoring technologies that are desperately needed to save spees fisheries forests coral reefs and more and a flat world means our best practitioners are more directly connected to the world’s best problem solvers so we can put our minds together in real time to develop and deploy innovative solutions to the most pressing problems fang nature and people today we must embrace the spectacular possibilities for linking humanity in support of nature that a flat world affords after all that is what  was born to do to inspire compel and galvanize technical skills monetary resources and political influence across the world to save those places we hold most dear at  we are impatient for change to secure this planet that is our home we won’t rest until it happens and we are profoundly grateful for our partners and supporters helping to make it so
