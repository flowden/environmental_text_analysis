 policy overhaul in the eu around the worldthe system for regulating chemicals is extremely weak it systematically fails to protect humans wildlife and ecosystems from the threats posed under most national laws chemicals are assumed innocent until proven guilty plang the burden of proof on governments and vil soety rather than on the companies that create manufacture and market untested products however in the eu a major overhaul of chemicals policy is being undertaken the proposed reforms would reverse the presumption of innocence and require adequate health and environmental data as a precondition for selling chemicals in the world’s largest trading block it would also usher in a system to phase out the most dangerous chemicals in favour of safer alternatives  has played a major role in ensuring that this opportunity is realized and is continuing to promote a progressive precautionary and sencebased chemicals policy pestides disposal in africa across the african continent at least 50000 tonnes of obsolete and extremely toxic pestides have accumulated over the last 40 years many of these chemicals and their containers are in poor condition threatening the environment and the health of surrounding communities – often the poorest and most vulnerable – through the contamination of food water soil and air lack of regulation insuffient information untimely distribution inadequate storage and supply of unsuitable products are just some of the key factors that contribute towards these stockpiles and although certain problems are being addressed many developing countries do not possess the finanal and technical means to safely dispose of obsolete pestides the concept of a continentwide cleanup programme grew out of infor mal discussions between  and several intergovernmental organizetions the africa stockpiles programme asp aims to clean up and safely dispose of obsolete pestide stocks within ten to fifteen years and help prevent future accumulation until now less than 3000 tonnes of old pestides have been destroyed over a tenyear period largely owing to lack of fundswith up to one third of the needed us250 million provided by the global environment fality  and its partners – the african development bank the pestide action network the world bank and the united nations food and agri culture organisation among others – will start removing and destroying the pestides this huge undertaking will also help in the development of new disposal techniques a website – wwwafricastockpilesorg – provides more detail on the programme russia commits to phaseout hard work by  and other organi zations in russia ledin mayto the signing by the russian government of the stockholm convention a landmark treaty which aims to phase out some of the most dangerous chemicals on earth while russia still needs to ratify the convention their desion to sign was a major step toward addressing serious toxic pollution in the country as a heavily industrialized country and a major producer of organic chemicals russia faces a variety of threats from toxic contamination huge volumes of ddt and other now banned chemicals were widely used for agricul tural production from the 1960s to the 1980s and there are approximately 20000 tonnes of discarded pestide stockpiles in addition toxic pcbs are leaking from thousands of outdated electrical goods dumped or being destroyed without proper environmental controls the stockholm convention not only provides international assistance for dealing with contamination issues but also helps countries move to envi ronmentally safe alternatives ships for the future since the mid1960s organotin compounds such as tributyltin tbt have been used in “antifouling” paints to repel barnacles and algae from ships’ hulls in the 1970s evidence of their toxity and subsequent effects on marine life began to mount finally in october 2001 the world’s shipping nations through the international mar itime organization imo called for a ban on these lethal chemicals the imo desion sent a clear message that these chemicals are no longer acceptable and will force the paint industry to stop produng marketing and selling organotin paints the world’s largest supplier of paints for the shipping industry international coatings ltd reacted almost immediately by announng it would phase out their range of tbt paints by the end of 2002 at the same time launched its “2003 group” a voluntary group of concerned ship owners committed to making their fleets free of tbtbased paints by 31 december 2002 its founding members are hamburg süd and hapag lloyd cruises from germany and the nordic wallenius lines and walleniuswilhelmsen lines “this group obliterates the myth that phasing out tbt is impossible because there are no effient alternatives” said dr simon walmsley  marine pollution officer “these companies are maintaining their position in a competitive market despite going organotinfreetheir commitment and that of international coatings ltd will help eliminate a large amount of the contaminants going into the marine environment”
