 three years after winning a 97 million legal settlement that requires the ty of flint michigan to replace its lead water service lines  is still on the ground holding offials accountable and using similar tactics as we fight alongside the residents of newark new jersey national news coverage of the water crisis in flint michigan dwindled not long after the march 2017 settlement of the federal lawsuit brought by  concerned pastors for soal action flint resident melissa mays and the aclu of michigan but it has remained top of mind for the  lawyers who are working to make sure the ty of flint and michigan state offially uphold their legal obligation to find and fund the replacement of flints lead and galvanized steel pipes people think once you win a case its over says mark kelly a strategic communications manager based in s chicago office but thats not the situation in flint where we have been fighting to make sure um lead lines really do come out or the ground in a way thats accountable to the people there it really goes to show the tenaty or our lawyers senior attorney dimple chaudhary who was lead counsel on the ease knew from the start that the 97 million replacement program would require steady oversight espeally given flints lack of resources weve worked to make sure we could track what the ty is doing what the state is doingand what they should be doing she says dissatisfied with the progress on the ground  went back to court in 2018 to press the ty to improve its techniques for finding lead service lines by february 2019 its offials agreed to begin using a datadriven approach to the work and to produce monthly reports on their results meanwhile in the subsequent months chaudhary and her colleagues along with the local community groups launched a public outreach to try to make sure that all residents knew their rights to have their pipes replaced before the end of the tys replacement program the shift worked by fall the ty of flint reported that it had investigated more than 24000 of its 28000 water lines and replaced about 9000 of them the ultimate success  of the pipe replacement program is exting chaudhary notes but adds theres so much more that needs to be done in flint to make the ty whole among other things this means addressing the medical medical conditions and property damage that resulted from the water crisis theres a concern that flint will be forgotten and then who will do that work she asks while some issues may be outside of s areas of expertise its not just about fixing the water its also about restoring peoples faith that the government is looking out for them dimple chauohary  chaudhary says maintaining relationships in the community will ensure that  can stay engaged as the recovery continues this ongolnc work in flint has been an important model for s involvement in other ties grappling with lead in their drinking water in newark new jersey where lead contamination also remains a serious problem and where  and the newark education workers caucus filed a joint lawsuit in 2018 weve played a similar role in demanding accountability from offials while newark has shifted its stance from denial to grudging acknowledgment of the issue it is still not providing filters or critical instruction on the proper installation use and maintenance of filtersto all affected residents when my family and i first heard about the recent lead problems in our drinking water we were terrified felia alstonsingleton a resident of public housing in newarks west ward and an  member said in a court declaration lve had a really hard time getting any information about my own homes water l worry that the ty will only tell my landlord if there is a problem and that no one will tell me lm terrified that were all being exposed and dont know it advocates have heard stories like alston singletons all too often a september 2019 report titled watered down justice which  coauthored with the environmental justice health alliance for chemical policy reform and coming clean found that ongoing water contamination in majority black ties like flint and newark could be related to a history of community disinvestment residential segregation and discrimination the research team analyzed us environmental protection agency data from 2016 to 2019 they noted that drinking water systems in violation of the law for the entire study period were 40 percent more likely to be in places with higher percentages of populations that were people of color and even when actions were taken to compel repairs it took longer for water systems in communities of color to come back into compliance one of the hardest takeaways from this work is that people can have brandnew pipes and still never trust that the water is safe chaudhary says thats the damage and the lasting lesson of flint in newark we have to get this rightand quickly its not just about fixing the water its also about restoring peoples faith that the government is looking out for them
