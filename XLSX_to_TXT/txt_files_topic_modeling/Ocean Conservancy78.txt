 by every measure 2008 was a remarkable year for  we made tremendous strides in ending overfishing in the gulf of mexico in bringing order to the ocean through laws like the massachusetts ocean act and in finding new—perhaps surprising— partners in the seafood industry to ensure that all seafood is sustainable seafood we made significant progress as well in realizing a net work of marine protected areas in california and then immediately set about working to broaden this network along the expanse of the california coast on capitol hill we became one of the “goto” advisers as national lawmakers debated matters like climate change drilling on the outer continental shelf and the burgeoning fishfarming industry we also began taking action to directly address the challenges of climate change particularly in the arctic a region that is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the planet at every turn  reminded the world that climate change is at its heart a crisis that begins with the ocean as we write this letter however the nation is embroiled in a serious finanal crisis the likes of which have not been seen for decades the impacts can be felt throughout the nonprofit community like the environmental climate that concerns us so much the finanal climate is also reshaping the way we do business rest assured however that  is adapting and 2008 turned out to be a good year for us finanally our programs reflect that abundance so while we and the nation brace for difficult economic times ahead we want to remind ourselves that in tough times staying focused on ocean health is as critical to our economic future as it is to our environmental future no matter how you look at it good conservation policy is good economic policy our vigilance for the ocean has never been more important surely our nation has learned by now that economic and ecological health are intrinsically bound to one another you’ll be pleased to know that our list of accomplishments in 2008 reflects this philosophy for ’s part we are doing everything in our power to improve effiency while sacrifing none of our commitment to improving ocean health we are directing more of our valuable support to our programmatic work and less to overhead to that end you may notice some differences in our annual report this year’s report cost approximately 50 percent less to produce than last year’s while certainly leaner it is no less informative and is as always printed on recycled materials we are simply doing more with what we have and looking at this as a time of abundance of opportunity not austerity of resources each day we are made more aware of the generous finanal support of ’s faithful members and our partners in the conservation corporate and foundation communities the responsibility is awesome indeed but we are strategically channeling our resources to accomplish maximum conservation impact we understand that people have choices on where to direct their philanthropy the fact that you have chosen  means that you understand the deep connection between ocean health and our very survival on planet earth your support is what keeps this organization moving forward we cannot thank you enough for your generosity these are indeed challenging times in more ways than one but tough times call for tough people and that is why we firmly believe that this time unlike any other is the time for sea change and why  is the organization to lead us there
