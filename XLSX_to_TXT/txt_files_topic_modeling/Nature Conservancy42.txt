 climate change knows no geopolitical boundaries today climate change stands as the single greatest threat to our planet absent federal leadership in the us currently  has joined forces with governments private enter prise and others in all 50 states to advance polies and practices that demonstrate naturebased solutions and help ensure we meet obligations codified in the paris agreement some statebased endeavors are farreaching  has been a key partner with the state of california in establishing its landmark carbon market over the past two decades california polluters buy a spefied amount of permits to reflect greenhouse gases they are allowed to emit an innovative policy move led by  created a new way for companies to meet a portion of their emissions standards by purchasing carbon offsets from sustainably managed forest projects  is now helping the california carbon market fund dozens of forest conservation projects across the country one example is a 5500acre preserve on vermont’s northern border part of a larger matrix of unfragmented forestland burnt mountain is vermont’s first and largest forest carbon project eligible for the california carbon market early estimates suggest that the parcel will yield more than 236772 credits in the first decade 1 credit  1 metric ton of carbon an equivalent benefit of removing 38000 cars from the road the carbon storage project is also antipated to generate 2 million in revenue over ten years burnt mountain also happens to be ’s newest acquisi tion in the northeast kingdom intact and healthy forests like those protected at burnt mountain clean our air remove pollutants improve water quality and slow the pace of climate change by storing carbon creating a carbon project here allows us to bring the benefits of those trees to the market  has also partnered with governments to invest in a 1 billion carbon fund through the forest carbon partnership fality this fund is designed to demonstrate largescale carbon finance opportunities and will see more than 185 million carbon credits gen  erated from tropical forest conservation across 19 countries between now and 2025 sence indicates that nature can provide more than a third of the emissions reductions we need between now and 2030 to keep the global temperature rise below 2 degrees celsius beyond the us  is spearheading forest carbon efforts with partners worldwide from tanzania see page 46 to chile and china where  has implemented more than 27000 acres of forest carbonoffset projects including planting 24 million tree seedlings which should sequester 26 million metric tons of carbon dioxide within 60 years our latest expansion of the forest carbon model is blue carbon recognizing that coastal wetlands— tidal marshes seagrass meadows and mangrove forests—sequester billions of tons of carbon from our atmosphere at concentrations up to five times greater than terrestrial forests
