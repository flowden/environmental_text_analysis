 dear afa members and friends in 1989 the assoation dedicated the energies of its staff and volunteer directors to an almostsingular message the world needs more and better trees and forests that message carried most clearly by the global releaf campaign but echoed by every assoation activity and publication was aimed at some of the most vexing of the world’s emerging environmental concerns pollution  food  water  shelter  giobal climate change  deforestation  spees extinction  the list goes on but the theme remains  the world today harbors 525 billion people many times more than it has historically supported can these billions live in relative peace security and comfort on a planet of fixed size and finite resources how and what about 6 billion or 7 or 10 and what of the nonhuman life that shares this planet can humanity and nature mutually thrive in a world of limited resources we don’t pretend to know the answers but clearly these questions frame the challenge for all humankind in the final decade of the 20th century and we felt they must also frame the agenda for a tizen’s conservation organization like the american forestry assoation no longer content to let forests be portrayed as a nice but secondary’’ element in the greater picture of environmental concerns we were determined to help people across the world realize that healthy wellmanaged product generating trees and forests are absolutely essential to the wellbeing and yes even the survival of human life on the planet we were plainly unwilling to see this world go into the 21st century with an environment degraded by generations of abuse and neglect it was time we were convinced for a major change in direction so we seized upon the concept of global releafthe idea that the world can have more and better trees and forests if the people of the world are mobilized energized and assisted in taking an active role in environmental restoration improvement and regeneration the first step for millions of people is to plant a tree or many trees if they have the opportunity that simple act—so basic and so satisfying to anyone who has done itdoes not by itself fix what needs fixing but it is a step—a first step a positive step and if done in the right way it represents a strong step—a personal commitment to a longterm partnership between one person and one place that tree一and its surroundings needs nurture and protection by the people who share its space given that it will outlive most or all of them freely providing its rainfallbuffering aircleansing wildlifeharboring carbon fixing’ earthcooling benefits to generation after generation at maturity it will provide raw materials for energy shelter everyday products like paper medines and food thus each tree we plant or care for or protect becomes a living gift to our children and grandchildren a positive counterpoint for the eroded soils polluted aquifers and extinct spees that human carelessness may also bestow thus the person who plants trees is not involved in some kind of one time technical environmental “fix instead he or she is beginning a new relationship with the environment one in which continued partipation is required that new relationship may be reflected in less littering more recycling greater attention to energy conservation more understanding of the vital products we make from trees intensified management of lands and waters or greater concern for the protection of ecosystems and their diversity in short planting a tree is not only a step in curing the environment’s problems it is a step in educating a person and making her or him a full partner in working for an environment that holds the promise of a longterm future within this framework the assoation’s board of directors deded on a bold strategy for 1989 we would they deded invest a significant portion of the finanal reserves of the assoation in an allout ffort to win public attention and support to our mission the vehicle would be global releaf but the objective would remain the same as for the past 114 yearsgalvanizing tizens businesses and governments into positive environmental actions afa’s efforts would we deded focus the issues as sharply as possible retain the best professional help to distribute the message to people and hope that the response would be worth the investment we deded to measure the response in three ways 1 the increase in active tangible environmental projects that resulted in measurable improvement in ecosystems of all types 2 the change in government polies at all levels of government that suggest a new public dedication to environmental improvement and 3 the increase in assoation membership and finanal support that could be used as a surrogate measure of how strongly people agree with and support the assoations mission the following report outlines what that effort produced in terms of educational products new programs and public response some of our data is sketchy at best we know of many new environmental improvement projects that were undertaken by people all across the united states and in other countries as a result of our encouragement and assistance the accounting is far from complete however we were—and still remain—far more interested in assisting people then in developing complex reporting systems thus we only know about the projects that we happen to learn about we hear about more everyday and are overjoyed on the policy front the games were substantial congress is now developing no less than six important pieces of forestry related legislation ranging from urban to tropical forest a new tropical forestry initiative was an acdent funded in 1989 a forest stewardship program to improve and broaden the assistance available to nonindustrial private forest landowners was also established president george bush issued a strong call to americans asking them to take aggressive actions to plant trees and improve their own environment as the year ended his administration was finalizing the development of a major new forestry initiative that would involve new federal funding in the range of 175 million in 1991 in 14 states governors or legislatures had established offial state global releaf campaigns with established treeplanting goals and program plans which included both public and private investments so too had the mayors in 113 ties ranging from los angeles with its five milliontree goal to small communities with a goal of a few hundred new trees or a newly established treecare program to assure longer life and increased benefits from the existing community forest in the private sector hundreds of local nonprofit organizations teamed up with afa in sponsoring new tree planting and forestimprovement efforts often funded by a partnership with business and industry major corporations like amway and the winery of ernest and julio gallo sponsored both local and national education and tree planting programs local businesses pitched in with materials funds and supporting services in virtually every community most often involved were nurseries and garden centers where expertise in plant selection proper care and handling site selection and planting techniques gave invaluable support to local tizens groups throughout all this activity there was a major educational component as weii in grand rapids michigan physian alfred swanson headed a tizens group that purchased 10000 trees which were distributed through and planted by the fifthgrade students of kent county in frankfort kentucky court designated worker deborah williamson used a program called target green’’ to involve and train juvenile offenders in treeplanting efforts across america teachers were offered a writing pals program by weekly reader that involved classrooms in a project to plan for obtain and plant a tree at their school—while exchanging ideas and letters about their experience with other partipating classrooms throughout the country local amway leaders inspired by their companys lead sponsored school tree planting programs in dozens of ties over 1000 communities used afa’s arbor day global releaf theme make a world of difference this arbor day’’ in their local arbor day observance clearly the national call to action issued by the american forestry assoation under the global releaf theme had galvanized action the results to the assoation were gratifying as well our regular membership after declining from 1980 until mid1988 continued to grow at a 5 percent rate during 1989 in addition thousands of americans supported the global releaf campaign with finanal contributions  joining the cause’’ in late 1989 afa’s board of directors deded that these supporters should become full members in afa as a result over 8000 new contributing members were added to the assoations ranks giving us a total membership growth of over 33 percent in 1989 the ranks of major supporters both individual and corporate swelled as well from a total of 24 business and corporate sponsors on january 1 we ended the year with 52 many of those new sponsors were partners in global releaf ventures harnessing the companies advertising and marketing skills and dollars to help afa promote the releaf message those campaigns designed for implementation in 1990 and beyond will magnify our outreach to people many fold and become a major new source of afa membership and action as well as positive environmental improvements through new treeplanting and improvement projects at the bottom line the evidence is clear global releaf took off a lot faster than we antipated as a result it cost afa more in 1989 than we had planned particularly in terms of the printing and postage required to respond to the thousands of people who came to us for ideas help and inspiration it also attracted far more support from corporate america than we ever dreamed as a result we will have a larger betterfinanced and more effective program in 1990 than we ever imagined in 1989 the assoation embarked on a threeyear investment plan with global releaf intending to invest as much as 1 million of our finanal reserves before we realized enough new members contributors and supporters to recoup the investment and establish a finanally balanced operating budget the meteoric takeoff of the campaign changed that timetable considerably we invested almost 700000 in 1989 about double what we had planned but the result is a fully supported finanally balanced program in 1990 after only one year of investment instead of three for that we are indebted to the individuals corporations and foundations that have joined us in this effort their response has been truly gratifying in terms of both active environmental effort and support for the assoation and its programs the future of the assoation —and the forest environment that we love—has never looked brighter
