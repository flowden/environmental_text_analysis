 a conservation strategy built around a key spees is pretty straightforward—and highly effective it’s also the basis for audubon’s strategic plan which targets 64 priority bird spees and 118 million acres of critical habitat across the americas if you protect a spees by saving significant blocks of its habitat other spees will also benefit audubon pioneered this approach on behalf of the sagegrouse last year we worked with the us fish and wildlife service to use the strategy for other imperiled spees next well roll out the plan to protect birds beyond the mountain west saving sagegrouse five years ago when audubon wyoming set out to save the sagebrush ecosystem it found the means to create protective policy for the greater sagegrouse we wanted to steer development in the interior west espeally energy development to areas where impacts on birds would be minimal our immediate goal was to identify and protect the most critical sagegrouse habitat but we also knew that a range of other wildlife would benefit— from grassland birds including the sage sparrow and the brewer’s sparrow to pronghorn antelope and elk while we can protect large chunks of habitat the reality is that we can’t save everything so we must focus our conservation strategies on the most valuable places in wyoming audubon worked with a range of stakeholders from state and federal agenes to the oil gas and wind industries and ranchers audubon sentists created maps that pinpointed core areas crual to the sagegrouse the 14 million acres they settled on encompassed a little more than 20 percent of wyoming but included breeding habitat for 80 percent of its sage grouse taking into consideration research showing that the birds avoid juniper trees and drilling rigs in the winter and that the related prairiechicken steers clear of wind turbines the task force recommended that core area “surface disturbance”—gas wells wind turbines roads pipelines even overhead transmission lines—be limited to a maximum of five percent of each square mile today audubon’s pioneering approach to sagegrouse conservation is sweeping across the west a number of states—washington oregon idaho and nevada—are submitting sagegrouse management plans to the us fish and wildlife service utah colorado and montana have plans in the works too audubon’s effort has already protected 15 million acres and growing across the west laying a foundation for responsible energy development in the region work with the usfws this past year when the us fish and wildlife service was seeking a cuttingedge corehabitat strategy to use as a model for conservation nationwide the success of our work with sagegrouse convinced the agency that our approach could be widely applied to other imperiled spees and habitats across the hemisphere as usfws director dan ashe said “i see great potential in cooperating with audubon to develop common speesbased objectives and to work together to ensure landscapescale conservation is achieved” audubon’s key spees strategy will be the subject of a 2013 forum held by the usfws and the  and cohosted by audubon putting it into practice audubon’s policy sence and conservation teams have identified additional spees that would benefit from the sagegrouse approach so far we have identified nine key spees representing all four flyways including the western sandpiper the lesser prairiechicken the cerulean warbler and the piping plover one spees already benefiting from this strategy is the yellowbilled cuckoo our western rivers initiative in arizona and new mexico focuses in part on the imperiled riparian woodlands the spees depends on to survive by focusing our conservation work on the remaining large tracts of cottonwoods and willows we can save critical habitat for the yellowbilled cuckoo currently a candidate for the endangered spees list that will in turn benefit other birds including the southwestern willow flycatcher and other wildlife as well
