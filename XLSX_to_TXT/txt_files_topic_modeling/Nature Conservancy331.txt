 raimunda luíza yawanawá is a graduate of the amazon indigenous training center cafi in manaus brazil and a member of the yawanawá indigenous group “i am a curious person i came to the amazon indigenous training center because i wanted to learn and i wanted to learn to be able to support my people one of my indigenous sisters within my organization told me about the course at cafi that it was a course where people learned about environmental management when i saw the notice about cafi i thought ‘this is perfect for me’ because everything related to the earth i like most of my indigenous brothers are rubber tappers or bricklayers and the only opportunity for them to study was in rio branco for me cafi is the same opportunity cafi is a conquest where indigenous people learn together it will form great leaders for the future i feel very privileged to be partipating in cafi cafi is a history that we are planting to take good fruits back to our people one day i want to be able to pass this on to new generations”
