 does more water in streams mean more fish data from trout unlimited’s project at wasson creek montana funded in part by  suggests that even a little more stream flow can mean a lot more trout trout unlimited’s project involved redung some of the water lost to wasson creek for an agricultural diversion this put about 75 cubic feet per second of water back in the creek from an aquatic standpoint this helped reconnect wasson creek with nearby nevada springs creek even this small amount of water helped restore fish westslope cutthroat trout are rebounding below where the diversion was decreased there are also more cutthroats above the diversion probably because the increased flows allowed fish to move into this area from downstream cutthroats are also increasing near where the two creeks join also displang nonnative brown trout increasing water flow is an intermediate metric as it applies to fish conservation more fish as documented in surveys like those at wasson creek means we are meeting our conservation target
