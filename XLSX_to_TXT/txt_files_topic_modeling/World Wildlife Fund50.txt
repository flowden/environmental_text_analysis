tropical forests or wetlands spanning one or more countries or entire coral reef systems such as the mesoamerican caribbean reef which extends 700 kilometres from the tip of the yucatan peninsula in

and which must be protected if we are to leave a living planet for future generations  alone cannot save all of them so the organization has chosen a representative selection of 40 for which to develop action plans ambitious broadscale and involving partners from all sectors these plans combine environmental economic and soal actions to conserve or restore the biodiversity of an entire ecoregion four of the ecoregions in which  is working are described in this report action for a living planet launched in 1996 the “gift to the earth” is ’s highest accolade for the significant
