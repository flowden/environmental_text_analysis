 in 2003  began a landmark initiative to evaluate the impacts of our conservation investments over the past two decades our goals are straightforward we want to learn what worked what didn’t and why evaluation is a form of adaptive management that permits  to continuously monitor and upgrade our programs we are eager to share these lessons without partners within the conservation community to improve everyone’s performance this is an ideal moment to evaluate our investments since 1986 the foundation has awarded more than 6400 grants with a total value of more than 786 millionthousands of projects on the ground offer a rich lode of data to mine in order to learn more about effective conservationin this first year of evaluation we have barely scratched the surface but we’ve learned enough to help improve our programs and increase their effectiveness three major evaluation projects were funded in 2003 these evaluations involved surveys interviews and performance metrics in “metaanalyzing” funded grants heres a brief summary from each study washington trout a nonprofit based in duvall washington assessed the impact of 60 grants for improving culverts on streams in nine western states culverts permit fish to bypass obstacles that road building or other human activities often create robbing fish including chinook coho steelhead cutthroat and bull trout and other spees of hundreds of miles of prime habitat washington trout assessed whether the funded culvert projects were effective by reviewing the documents of the 60 grants and interviewing the project sponsors the investigators created statistics for measuring the “conservation benefit” of each fish passage project their key findings include these 60 projects resulted in opening more than 217 miles of fish habitat technical problems involving installation played a big part in the relative costs and benefits accounted to each project sence is important to successful work in culverts from assessing needs at the outset to assessing ecological impacts after projects end projects with high conservation benefit addressed the needs of multiple spees funding projects in watersheds that are speesrich is costeffective hardner  gullison llp of california evaluate the effectiveness of shell’s marine habitat program on conservation in the gulf of mexico since 1998  partnership with shell has funded 79 projects see p 21 39 were evaluated for the study the evaluators first interviewed 135 grantees and stakeholders located in six regions in the southeast and then conducted an online survey of 653 stakeholders this evaluation’s focus addressed whether the projects were improving the gulf coastal environment and whether grant monies were being used effectively the evaluators conclude that this program is showing strong “signaling”—drawing other donors to contribute shell’s 41 million investment leveraged an additional 10 million from  and our grantees this program is bringing credibility to grantee projects enhanng their opportunities to raise funds from other sources in addressing key priorities within the gulfof mexico grantees consider  effective and identified areas for future administrative improvement the wildlife company of georgia and north woods consulting of ohio evaluated  grants for research on forest management practices and their effect on nesting birds the evaluators reviewed 11 multiyear projects selected on a number of distinct criteria the evaluators assessed nine distinct objectives and their performance methods and core indicators through reviewing project files conducting site visits and interviewing key stakeholders among the key findings were that  did an excellent job identifying priority research supporting quality projects involving diverse stakeholders and stimulating more research through our funding should work more closely with sentists to translate their results into practical guidance for land managers must become more active in translating research into forest management practices our aim should be to cut “lag time” between when research concludes and when its results make their way to managers for practical application should emphasize funding for projects that emphasize upfront collaboration between researchers and managers evaluation allows us to broaden our benefit to the conservation community from 20 years of grantmaking our evaluation efforts will guide future strategic desionmaking in best using our investments to achieve longterm ecological impacts readers interested in obtaining the full reports or learning more generally about evaluation activities at  should contact matthew birnbaum phd in our national office
