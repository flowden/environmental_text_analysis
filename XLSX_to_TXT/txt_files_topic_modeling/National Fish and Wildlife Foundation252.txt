 the ’s targeted watershed grant twg program a partnership with the environmental protection agency is measurably redung the flow of nitrogen and phosphorus into the chesapeake bay the overload of these two nutrients is the prime culprit in the degradation of the bay’s environment and redung their presence is a primary conservation goal it is estimated that on an annual basis about 285 million pounds of nitrogen and 19 million pounds of phosphorus make it into the bay through runoff and atmospheric deposition conservation partners have set the ambitious target of redung this load to 175 million and 128 million pounds annually respectively thus the goal is to remove the difference 11 0 million pounds of nitrogen and 62 million pounds of phosphorus the projected benefits from twg projects funded in 2007 amount to nearly 14 million pounds of nitrogen and 650000 pounds of phosphorus that represents 125 of the nitrogen goal and 105 of the phosphorus goal since the twg program’s onset in 2006  has supported projects that if successful will prevent 66 million pounds of nitrogen and 4 million pounds of phosphorus from entering the bay—that’s 6 of the total nitrogen reduction goal and a staggering 65 of the phosphorus reduction goal keystones represent a core portfolio of issuespefic programs with clear longterm goals and wellarticulated strategies to achieve meaningful and measurable conservation outcomes through keystones the  proactively identifies grantees evaluates best practices and innovative solutions and enters into strategic alliances with partners to help “move the needle” on important conservation issues together with our other grant programs the keystones will shape ’s conservation agenda in the years ahead
