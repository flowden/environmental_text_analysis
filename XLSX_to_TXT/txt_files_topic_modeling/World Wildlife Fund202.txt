 author and environmentalist wendell berry wrote “to speak of the health of an isolated individual is a contradiction in terms” the same should be said about  because while us operates within the context of our worldwide network working in over 100 countries even  globally is just one player of many working to bend the curves of environmental destruction that bedevil our planet  we recently completed an intensive review of our work and determined to set goals that mattered not just to  but also to the world so we followed the lead of over 190 countries that recently approved the united nations’ sustainable development goals if you take a close look at these 17 goals you can see how far the world has come in realizing how much humanity’s future depends upon the health of the planet these goals all must be realized on a planetary level if we are to reverse the destruction of our natural home— whether that plays out in the context of oceans forests climate wildlife food or freshwater in each and every case success in our work depends on understanding the institutions or systems that will play the most important roles and then relying on our strengths and capabilities to influence or support them in deding what the world needs which means leveraging our sence our search for solutions our work in influenng markets and corporate behavior and our engagement with policymakers and the american public in the choices that they make while the deep and thoughtful strategic review we undertook may have been necessary we’re not saying it was easy anything worth doing rarely is but against the backdrop of increasingly stark environmental realities around the world—prepitously declining wildlife populations recordhigh levels of carbon in the atmosphere increased stress on already dwindling water supplies and more—the need for change was undeniable ultimately the fate of the planet depends upon many actors operating together of course we are not the only institution that matters—but as the world’s largest conservation group we have an important part to play in concert with others and so we should always see our role as providing support tools solutions and advocacy while challenging the world to drive for sustainability and never accept a trajectory that takes us down the path of our own destruction we remain committed to making the highest and best use of our institutional assets—most important your generous donations and we face the future emboldened with the confidence that we can deliver the change our planet so desperately needs as you read through the pages of this annual report we hope you’ll agree
