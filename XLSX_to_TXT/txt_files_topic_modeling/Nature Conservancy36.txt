 ten years ago i arrived at  from wall street ready for a new challenge to make the world a better place it might seem glib but that’s exactly what i found every day i come to work i roll up my sleeves and i get to dig in with my colleagues on our four priorities protect land and water tackle climate change provide food and water sustainably and build healthy ties together these four areas make up ’s shared conservation agenda—our north star for conservation efforts my job allows me to witness in action the significant progress we are making toward these very ambitious and important goals what’s more i get to work alongside the most dedicated and inspiring people i’ve ever met i can’t help but feel optimistic on the other hand i want to be a realist i don’t want to be naive all around the world environmental organizations like  face some very serious political headwinds and the nature of our work is only becoming more difficult and more complex to tackle these enormous challenging goals we have to work bigger faster and smarter  has done the sence we’ve run the numbers we know that a sustainable world is possible if soety makes big changes now and at  we have the responsibility to help lead the way by applying what we’ve learned from 68 years of conservation experience collaborating with experts across sectors and taking our work to a global scale we really can make a difference on the land and water protection front that means focusing on truly big transformative projects—like our recordsetting acquisition of a crual unprotected stretch of california’s coast which includes rare woodlands and marine habitats see page 6 it also means acknowledging that a lasting protection strategy doesn’t end with close of sale to that end we’ve formed landmark partnerships with indigenous communities to strengthen their roles in protecting their land and water on a continental scale we also support our land trust allies to take on local efforts to tackle climate change we cannot wait for us federal leadership to have a change of heart—we have to work faster time is not on our side  is forming partnerships with those who are ready to act at the ty and state level and leveraging that action to have a global impact and we are demonstrating how nat ural climate solutions work on the ground from indonesia and tanzania to here in the americas this work is a powerful example of local action with global reach see page 28 feeding a growing world population without sacrifing nature requires us to work smarter and accelerate the development testing and expansion of technology we’re working with partners to develop tools that enable farmers and ranchers to use water more effiently prevent nutrient runoff and produce more on less land this technology revolution is also empowering fishers around the world to track their catch from ocean to table with a goal to make the world’s fisheries more sustainable see page 56 and as people move to urban areas at an unprece dented rate we are employing nature itself to improve quality of life and reduce pollution in ties around the world stormwater runoff for instance is the fastestgrowing source of pollution in our rivers and estuaries we are developing policy and finance solutions to rapidly scale up green infrastructure in places as diverse as china and the us see page 34 furthermore ty dwellers will become greater advocates for nature when they see its positive benefits immediately around them and they will be healthier too—thanks to the ecosystem services nature provides such as protection from sea level rise and extreme weather filtered air to breathe and clean water to drink we all have important roles to play to create a sus tainable future for generations to come at  we’re walking the talk by bringing our diverse and dispersed teams together to tackle our ambitious goals and achieve our shared conservation agenda it’s one of the many reasons i am so proud to lead this organization but the reality is we need more people and resources on our side we need more supporters like jack and laura dangermond whose 165 million donation to protect the former bixby ranch was the largest single philanthropic gift we’ve ever received
