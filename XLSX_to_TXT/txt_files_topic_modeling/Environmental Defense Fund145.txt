 the environmental protection agency in 2015 proposed the first national standards to cut methane pollution from oil and gas operations  was central to this important progress methane the main component of natural gas and a byproduct of oil production accounts for a quarter of the global warming we’re experienng today thanks in part to ’s leadership this onceignored climate issue is now on the map in 2012 as the shale gas boom accelerated no one could say exactly how much methane was leaking from the oil and gas supply chain so  launched our most ambitious sentific research ever 16 peerreviewed field studies involving nearly 100 partners from academia and industry to measure emissions across the entire us natural gas supply chain to date two dozen papers have been published based on the research it is now becoming clear that globally a 45 cut in methane pollution from oil and gas operations would have the same climate benefit over 20 years as shutting down roughly 1000 coalfired power plants methane emissions are at least 50 higher than previously estimated the results of ’s studies have been key to informing state and federal action but epa’s rules if adopted cover only new and modified sources more action is needed to reach the white house goal to reduce emissions 40–45 by 2025 so we’ll continue the fight  worked with industry in colorado to enact tough rules that cover both new and existing sources of methane showing that strong standards need not cost jobs or production  also challenged inventors to design realtime methane detectors which are now being tested “the  studies confirm there are costeffective technologies that will allow us to reduce methane emissions right now” says southwestern energy’s mark boling “and they are playing a key role in driving change in our industry”
