 two decades ago as timber companies clamored to raze america’s mighty oldgrowth forests  set out to identify the best opportunities to protect our nation’s remaining forest frontier we fixed our sights on the 17millionacre tongass rainforest in southeast alaska the crown jewel of america’s national forest system the tongass is home to thriving populations of grizzly bears salmon bald eagles and other wildlife through the years we have joined forces with our local partners again and again to keep the wild reaches of the tongass safe from logging and road building while extending our battleground eastward to canada’s vast boreal forest in 2011 fighting on each of these fronts we scored two landmark victories for north america’s last wild forests and the extraordinary wildlife that depends on them for survival in march following a prolonged court battle made possible by the strong support of our members a federal judge in alaska ruled in our favor and protected 95 million acres of pristine roadless areas in the tongass from destructive logging and road building our legal fight began in 2003 when we joined forces with earth justice alaskan natives local businesses and other groups to protect tongass wildlands after the bush administration illegally exempted the forest from the roadless rule this landmark rule bars timber sales and logging roads in undisturbed areas of our national forests eight years later we prevailed the court rejected a series of claims concocted by bush administration offials and agreed with us that there was no evidence that the roadless rule cost jobs in the tongass region interfered with plans to connect remote communities or caused instability for local businesses the judge struck down the bushera exemption and declared the roadless rule immediately reinstated moving forward we are defending the court’s desion against any appeals by the state of alaska and the timber industry finally we will continue to work toward accelerating the obama administration’s plan to end all oldgrowth logging in the tongass our second success story centers on ’s heart of the boreal forest biogem though most of the world’s original wild forests have been logged or developed approximately 80 percent of the boreal forest in canada is still undisturbed by roads in recent years though this sprawling northern wildland has come under threat from industrial logging and hydropower mining and oil and gas development over the past seven years  members and online activists have sent tens of thousands of messages urging canadian offials to allow the poplar river first nation to keep unwanted industrialization out of its traditional territory on the eastern coast of lake winnipeg and to manage these lands along with the wolves woodland caribou and songbird populations that live there in june the government of manitoba heeded our call and granted permanent protection to nearly 2 million acres in this swath of the boreal an area the size of yellowstone national park we are now one step closer to our goal of creating a world heritage site that would safeguard a full 10 million acres of this spectacular biogem despite these recent advances our continent’s vast oldgrowth forests continue to face an uncertain fate the obama administration weighed a proposal to construct a 2000mile pipe line that would have trans ported toxic tar sands oil from under the boreal forest to refineries in texas to help protect the boreal forest and its abundant wildlife from the ravages of tar sands strip mining we mobilized our members and online activists to escalate pressure on the white house to reject this destructive proposal—which it did now  is joining forces with the first nations and other local groups to protect canada’s spirit bear coast north america’s largest temperate rainforest from threats by yet another tar sands oil project
