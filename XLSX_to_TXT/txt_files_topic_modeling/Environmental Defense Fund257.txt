 mark boling a senior executive of southwestern energy and dr ramón alvarez a longtime  sentist are examining a remote natural gas drill site about 75 miles north of little rock arkansas they are in the fayetteville shale a giant shale gas deposit that cuts through the state the two men are seemingly on opposite sides of the rancorous shale gas debate but as they climb a drill rig under the watchful eye of supervisor chris varela they talk about how their partnership could help transform the way america taps its shale gas reserves this is an issue that matters to a lot of people as varela puts it “i want to make sure that we don’t mess up this land my family is here i hunt and fish here” in 1990 shale gas contributed 1 of us natural gas today it’s about 30 and rising since gas emits less carbon than coal when burned it could be one step in the shift to a clean energy economy and it already has created hundreds of thousands of jobs but shale gas extraction—which commonly involves hydraulic fracturing or fracking—also can pollute air and water and despoil landscapes in 2011  president fred krupp served on us energy secretary steven chu’s natural gas advisory board he and fellow board members visited rural pennsylvania where a mother told them she had been forced off her farm because of air pollution from gas wells her young son had become ill and she was living out of her car “we can’t ask people to trade away their health and quality of life in exchange for cheap energy” krupp said afterward he successfully urged the board to call for tighter pollution controls stronger enforcement and disclosure of chemicals water use and pollution  is fighting for these goals in 14 states that hold 85 of us onshore shale gas reserves in pennsylvania we’re supporting communities fighting to retain their rights to regulate drilling in colorado we helped set the standard for disclosure of fracking chemicals and in ohio our ideas on sound well construction are being enacted into regulation in addition last year alvarez and dr steven hamburg ’s chief sentist were among the authors of a peerreviewed paper that found the climate benefits of natural gas—which is mostly methane a potent greenhouse gas— could be lost for decades if too much leaks into the atmosphere now  is partipating in a series of five studies with companies and research universities to map leakage along the natural gas supply chain “there’ve been a lot of claims about leakage rates” says alvarez “but we’re using rigorous sentific methods to get the data we need to find and reduce leakage”
