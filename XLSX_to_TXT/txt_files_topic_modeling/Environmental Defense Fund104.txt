 shortly after amy and george greer moved to their 6700acre cattle ranch in the texas hill country in 2008 they stumbled upon a magical sight the trees bordering the creek on their property were festooned with thousands of monarch butterflies “i’ll never forget it” says amy greer a biologist and sixthgeneration rancher “we never saw anything like that again” the great annual migration of monarchs spans the entire continental united states but in just two decades the butterfly’s numbers have plummeted 90 sentists warn it could be extinct in 20 years if conservation efforts fail a key reason for the monarch’s decline is the loss of the spees’ milkweed habitat where butterflies lay their eggs and caterpillars feed in 2017  launched a nationwide campaign to save the monarch focusing on farmers who own much of the land along the “superhighways” used by monarchs to reach their mexican wintering grounds our goal is to restore 800000 acres of native habitat helping the spees weather multiple threats to encourage exchanges are now being launched in california missouri and texas a wide array of potential investors—from food companies to conservation funds and private tizens—has responded to the project recognizing that it will help all pollinators including native bees at the greer ranch and elsewhere  has developed habitat plans based on planting native flowering plants as well as a tool for measuring habitat quality so that investors have a baseline against which to measure progress all agriculture stakeholders from farmers to food companies have an incentive to help keep the butterfly from being listed as endangered such a listing could mean unwanted regulation and landuse the restoration of habitat we created the monarch butterfly habitat exchange where farmers and ranchers can earn credits for growing milkweed which are then sold through the exchange to buyers who want to see the monarch survive the us fish and wildlife service has approved  habitat exchanges as a preferred option for saving atrisk spees and the first restrictions for landowners “we can also use the income” adds george greer “i have a lot of respect for everything  does” says amy greer who also surveyed habitat for the blackcapped vireo with us “if we can take our piece of land and restore it to help the butterfly my hope is that will inspire others and we’ll get to the scale we need”
