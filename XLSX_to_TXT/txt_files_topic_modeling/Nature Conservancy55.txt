 stretching across northern canada from the yukon to newfoundland and labrador the country’s boreal forest is the largest intact forest remaining on earth this vast interconnected landscape provides habitat for billions of birds every spring gives room for moose and herds of woodland caribou to roam and stores 208 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide—the equivalent of 26 years of global carbon emissions for thousands of years first nations communities thrived within the richness and sustenance of the boreal as the land’s original stewards but as demand for resources grew their authority over their traditional territories was challenged their economies were destabilized and their immemorial way of living was threatened chief clarence easter leads the chemawawin cree nation in manitoba canada which is partnering with  canada “we belong to the land the land doesn’t belong to us i’ve always lived off the land growing up the land was your provider your mentor your healer the berries you pick the medines you get everything you got from the land  you didn’t rely on anyone else “in 1964 the chemawawin people were relocated by the government to make way for a dam we had no say that’s what people don’t like and they’ll resist it—all the way they damaged our area with the flooding before now they are going to desecrate it with cutting all the trees down to me that’s not right i’m not antidevelopment but we need to maintain a healthy forest as well how do we do that that’s where we need some capaty “i need some sence to be able to understand it and be able to say yes or no—to government to industry that’s what i want to bring to the table i’m hoping we can change some minds that’s what i want from this agreement with  canada not just for our people but for everybody else out there we need to turn over a new leaf the caribou the moose the ducks the muskrat the rabbits—they provided for us a long time before now we have to do something to provide for them i want to be able to come back in my next life to a clean environment that our grandchildren can live in that will help them make a living that’s what keeps me going that’s the whole essence of why i am here” the future  envisions a future where indigenous rights form the root of communityled conservation and economies we support the leadership of the chemawawin cree and 12 other first nations of the region and are working to strengthen their desionmaking authority over management of 35 million acres within their territories this year we held discussions to better understand the goals of each community we brought representatives together at a workshop to discuss sustainable forestry and offered training on natural resources planning next year we will continue to foster relationships with the first nations and support them in realizing their goals we will investigate sustainable economic development opportunities through adopting improved forest manage  ment practices including forest carbon markets we will help protect the habitat of moose a cultural mainspring by lending sentific expertise and we’ll falitate communitybased planning by sharing best practices among indigenous stewardship networks and assisting with finanng our hope is to create a new model of sustainable forest management and ensure the boreal’s original inhabitants remain its primary caretakers
