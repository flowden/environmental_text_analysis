 dealing with this massive pollution took a decade of effort by  and others we played a key role in supreme court cases that affirmed epa’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions when epa missed a deadline in april 2013 to release its new power plant standards  threatened legal action “we never gave up” says ’s general counsel vickie patton once the standards were proposed the coal industry petitioned the us supreme court to strip epa of its authority over carbon pollution  sprang into action joining 17 states we urged the court to deny the petitions and our action fund ran tv ads in eight states mobilizing tizens to shore up support in congress the proposed standards remain on track but a wellfunded coal lobby is trying to strongarm congress to cut funding for epa the best arguments against that lobby are the hardheaded calculations of the energy industry itself our partnership with xcel has helped transform states into test beds for the lowcarbon future when the obama administration wavered we made sure these business voices were heard “ and power companies are working together to show that commonsense progress is possible” says patton who led our legal team in defending the standards “we demonstrated that even in fastgrowing states you can provide reliable lowcost energy and make dramatic cuts in global warming pollution”
