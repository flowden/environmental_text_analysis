 this year   is celebrating 25 years of protecting nature for the wellbeing of humanity and as we reflect now on the many conservation milestones and victories we have realized it is gratifying to see just how far  has come—and humbling to consider just how far we have yet to go but as we stand on the verge of our next quartercentury we couldn’t be more encouraged by the progress we have made—and the difference we are making when  was founded on a snowy night at washington dc’s historic tabard inn in 1987 our success was anything but assured the small band of dedicated conservationists that gathered that evening had little more than a shared belief that the time for a new approach had come—that sence economics and local communities all have vital roles to play in international conservation in our first year we broke new ground by signing the firstever debtfornature swap agreement with the government of bolivia which was—just the first of many solutions we would pioneer in the years to come since then we have continued to innovate and scale up our efforts at a rapid pace and through it all we have stayed true to the ideals we’ve held since the beginning—our foundation of sence partnership and field demonstration remains as strong as ever and while our original mission was to protect biodiversity around the world the seeds of our renewed mission— protecting that biodiversity for the wellbeing of humanity— were there all along they were present in our early efforts and enterprises that were grounded by a simple understanding in order for conservation to succeed it must reconle both the needs of the planet and its people and it must secure both life and livelihoods today milestone by milestone we are witnessing this vision coming to fruition in ways and in proportions we once only could have imagined we see it in our work on the pafic oceanscape the most ambitious marine conservation in history where the leaders of 16 island nations are bringing cooperative management and protection to 10 percent of the planet’s ocean surface—an area larger than the surface of the moon these efforts aim to increase fish stocks empower community conservation and promote effective adaptation to the impacts of climate change we see it on the african continent where our pilot project with the bill  melinda gates foundation has given rise to a renewed commitment and funding to create vital signs—a robust monitoring network that will inform smart agricultural investment at a time of great intensification by measuring and integrating essential ecosystem services into desionmaking through vital signs a dynamic network of sentists and policymakers will benefit from critical data as they figure out how to produce enough food to feed the world’s growing population without damaging preous natural resources we see it on the world stage in forums like the summit for sustainability in africa—convened by his excellency ian khama president of botswana in cooperation with  board members rob walton and laurene powell jobs— where the leaders of 10 resourcerich nations committed to taking nature’s full measure and worth into their national accounting recognizing that healthy ecosystems underscore sustainable development these governments are pledging to follow an economic development path that considers the value of nature and its services and finally we see our vision becoming reality with the creation of the first trust fund to protect the amazonian rainforest territories of brazil’s kayapó indigenous peoples an initial donation of 8 million from ’s global conservation fund provided by the gordon and betty moore foundation and brazil’s national economic and soal development bank with support from the amazon fund will conserve 3 percent of the amazon while offering sustainable economic activities for 7000 people more than ever ’s mantra—that safeguarding our future lies in safeguarding our planet—is resonating with community leaders captains of industry and heads of state these leaders increasingly understand that it is in their enlightened selfinterest to properly value and protect the gifts of nature that sustain us so we embark on the next quartercentury with a renewed sense of hope and with your continued support confirmation that we are charting a path toward a brighter future for the planet and the seven billion of us—and counting—who call it home
