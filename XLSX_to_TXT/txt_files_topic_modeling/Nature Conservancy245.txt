 the conservancy is helping resurrect brazil’s atlantic forest from the brink of extinction although more than 85 percent of this oncevast forest has been cleared and the rest remains highly fragmented the atlantic forest still harbors a range of unique plants and animals that rivals that of the amazon besides wildlife habitat the atlantic forest provides drinking water to 130 million people in brazil including in its two largest ties são paulo and rio de janeiro and a restored healthy forest can also play an important role in sequestering carbon and helping stabilize our global climate conducting massive reforestation and securing the fragments that remain are primary strategies to save the atlantic forest eleven years ago the conservancy helped launch the guaraqueçaba climate action project in the atlantic forest — a pioneering carbon project — to help protect this endangered tropical forest from urban development illegal logging and land conversion by protecting standing forest and removing 860000 tons of carbon through reforestation the project will provide 12 million tons of carbon benefi ts over its 40year lifespan healthy forests help supply not only clean air but also clean water forests act like giant sponges by soaking up rain and gradually releasing it into streams the conservancy is protecting the clean water source for millions of brazilians through a program that pays farmers and ranchers about 31 per acre per year for “produng water” on land where trees have been planted and forests have been fenced off from cattle launched in 2008 the conservancy’s plant a billion trees campaign will help carry out these reforestation activities in strategic areas for water protection at just 1 per tree conservancy supporters have already donated enough funds to restore 75 million trees to the atlantic forest and help us reach our billiontree goal
