 for centuries people have thought of the oceans as an inexhaustible source of seafood but generations of heavy fishing and illconceived management have proved devastating for fish and coastal communities in the united states fishery managers typically tried to control fishing by shortening the season which gave rise to dangerous races in which boats go out in any weather in the frenzy crews were forced to discard tons of dead or dying fish the heavyhanded regulations failed to solve the overfishing problem  proposed a simpler smarter approach why not reward fishermen for being stewards of the resource we brought fishermen to washington and helped end a congressional moratorium on marketbased methods to protect fisheries we then helped design a catch share program for red snapper in the gulf of mexico since the program began in 2007 gulf snapper populations have tripled and other spees such as grouper have been added to the program in 2010 noaa adopted catch shares as part of its offial policy and  helped implement programs in new england and on the west coast today 65 of fish caught in federal waters are under catch shares fishermen who once fiercely competed now share information to avoid overfished spees and rather than fighting against protected areas many are now putting this conservation tool into action on their own in 2015 the national marine fisheries service declared that overfishing in us waters is steadily declining in part due to catch shares in recent years 32 commerally important fish stocks have been restored including several spees of pafic groundfish we’re now working to develop catch share programs for recreational fishing which accounts for half the red snapper catch in the gulf of mexico but currently is poorly managed we’re also using sence to understand how fisheries are changing as a result of global warming and to help inform how fisheries can be managed for greater resiliency in the face of climate change
