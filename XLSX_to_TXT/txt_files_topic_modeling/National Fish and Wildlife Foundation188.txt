 tucked away in the darkness of caves mineshafts and underpasses across america an insidious killer continues to demate one of north america’s most fasnating economically valuable and underappreated wild animals bats whitenose syndrome a disease caused by the fungus pseudogymnoascus destructans ranks as one of the most urgent threats to wildlife in the united states after its first detection in 2007 near albany new york the fungus has quickly spread throughout the appalachian region to midwestern states canada and more recently to texas south dakota california and washington the fungus lurks and lingers in damp dark places attacking bats while they hibernate through the winter the white fuzzy fungus o􀅌 en covers a bat’s face – hence the name – and causes them to behave erratically burning energy they need to survive the winter sentists estimate the disease has killed more than 6 million bats across the united states with more dying every year “the losses are tremendous” said dr winifred frick chief sentist at bat  “this crisis isn’t academic – these animals play a vital ecological role and contribute nearly 4 billion worth of free insect control to us agricultural efforts “whitenose disease represents a dire threat not just in terms of wildlife conservation but also for the country as a whole we need to move quickly to halt the spread of the disease and turn things around for these amazing creatures” working with a variety of public and private partners in 2017 the us fish and wildlife service and  created the bats for the future fund to test and deploy advanced techniques and tools to address this urgent conservation need during the fund’s most recent round of grantmaking completed in late 2018 the fund awarded more than 11 million to combat whitenose syndrome these awards leveraged more than 900000 in match from grantees generating a total conservation impact of 2 million grant awards included nearly 112000 to bat  researchers with the organization will test the effectiveness of two nontoxic agents ultraviolet light and polyethylene glycol in treating mine walls at the northern and southern edge of the disease’s advance other grants supported through the fund will advance similarly cuttingedge techniques one project will test automatic spray technology to apply liquid or gel treatment to bats as they fl y into or out of roosts then measure biomarkers to assess success rates another project will explore a gene silenng system induced by a virus to undermine the fungus causing whitenose syndrome yet another will assess the use of antifungal fumigants to treat bat hibernacula “whitenose syndrome poses a significant threat to bats in north america” said dr jeremy coleman national whitenose syndrome coordinator for the us fish and wildlife service “if we can’t improve survival of susceptible spees we could see the extinction of some native bats “ is playing a significant role by creating partnerships that leverage federal dollars to raise private funds to help support crual frontline efforts with time running short for some spees we need to do all we can right now to reduce the damage from whitenose syndrome and conserve our native bats”
