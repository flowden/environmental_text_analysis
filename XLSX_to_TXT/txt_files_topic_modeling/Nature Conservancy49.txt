importance as peru’s former prime minister mercedes aráoz put it the park “will not only conserve a natural sanctuary which is home to unique spees but also generate opportunities for indigenous families” demonstrating sustainable ranching in the andes an additional 1100 ranchers joined the sustainable ranching project undertaken by  and partners in colombia using a healthy agricultural systems approach that focuses on increas ing production while preserving natural assets—the water soil and rich biodiversity that make productivity possible—farmers are restoring habitat while increasing production profits and climate resilience six years of partnership have resulted in more than 4000 ranchers adopting this new farming paradigm a 17 percent increase in milk andor beef production and a reduction of 1 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions biodiversity monitoring on farms has registered 479 spees of birds—more than half as many bird spees as all of the united states reforesting a nation  played a leading role in designing forestar 2030 a new platform that unites six ministries to boost argentina’s economy and environmental sustainability through massive reforestation this pioneering initiative will help mitigate climate change and position argentina in the global forestry market the goal is to reach 2 million hectares more than 49 million acres of forested land by 2030 the platform is underpinned by sentific guidelines—provided by — which show that reforestation is one of the most effient naturebased lowcost solutions for mitigating climate change and meeting paris climate agreement commitments an economic case for restoring the atlantic forest the mantiqueira restoration project is an initiative that brings together stakeholders from 284 brazilian munipalities located near brazil’s biggest markets—the states of sao paulo rio de janeiro and minas gerais—to build a forest restoration network  and our partners collaborated to design and implement a training program for residents on forest restoration and agroforestry systems using atlantic forest plants our goal is to enable the restoration of 12 million hectares 29 million acres while showing that reforestation can create jobs and grow the economy implementing electronic traceability for fisheries with ’s support leaders of the 500member national fisher’s cooperative in belize adopted thisfish an electronic traceability system and a 2018 techstars sustainability accelerator winner to improve sustainability and livelihoods many of the cooperative’s members are from small fishing communities that have relied on lobster and conch fishing for generations members will benefit from the new seafood sourng technology which allows the cooperative’s staff to electronically track production by landings to individual fishers and regions and keep a product inventory the data will be used to make informed desions and empower fishers to become better stewards

cornerstone of its resilient ties strategy the water fund’s seven members— mexichem tibanamex cocacola femsa femsa foundation grupo modelo and hsbc— are providing seed capital for startup costs and an 800 hectare restoration pilot breaking the link between soy and deforestation  released agroideal an online tool that creates transparency for the brazilian soybean supply chain the free tool analyzes up to 18 indicators of soal and environmental risk and economic opportunity to help companies drive agriculture responsibly into previously cleared areas without disturbing the remaining natural ecosystems the tools initially covered brazil’s cerrado and expanded cover to amazonia and the argentinean chaco the tool reinforces the cerrado manifesto an urgent call to action from brazilian nongovern mental organizations to ensure soy and beef don’t contribute to deforestation signed by a growing coalition of global companies and investors fishpath enables fishers to be sustainable peru’s artisanal fisheries are unregulated resulting in the risk of overfishing and declining stocks fishpath developed by  and partners is an engagement process and desionsupport tool that helps local fishing communities assess monitor and manage coastal fisheries in collaboration with peru’s ocean institute  applied fishpath to assess chita peruvian grunt stocks and identified the most effective rules for the fishery including a yearly notake season for chita during the peak of reproductive activity fishpath also is being applied to assess five other commerally vital spees its success has extended to produce stock assessments and management strategies for fisheries at a national scale
