 all the spees work the foundation does counts for little unless we also work for where they live and one of the most critical habitats in america is sustainable wellmanaged forests to play off the old saying we see both the forest and the trees we try hard to translate research and evaluation results into best management practices in forest management then share them with private and public landowners funds from the alcoa foundation our leading forestry sponsor through its “saving our forests” initiative and others allow  to undertake evaluations of forest restoration programs and measure their effectiveness their funds also enable us to recruit new partners who strengthen the network of support for healthy forests forest restoration and best management practices for example  through the shell marine habitat fund provided 38300 in shell funds matched with 76700 to help the business counl for sustainable development restore bottomland hardwood forests in the mississippi valley watershed the counl helps private landowners to restore non produng land in the flood plain to its earlier life as hardwood forest by creating new sources of income for landowners from sustainable tree harvests and hunting leases how can a midwestern farmer help a gulf of mexico fisherman positive effects of funded forest restoration in heartland states extend far downstream healthy forests filter impurities from mississippi river water leaching out chemicals by preventing sedimentation whose outwash harms the gulf new forests also contribute to healthier riparian and marine habitats thousands of miles away but how do we know that individual forestry programs work well a  grant to natureserve funded the mapping of biodiversity in managed forests the huge acreages owned by timber companies accurate mapping helped show that corporations as well as conservation organizations are restoring health to american woodlands and their wildlife this is exemplified by the effort spearheaded by the southern company to restore longleaf pine forests across the south thereby greatly helping to address the decline of redcockaded woodpeckers and bobwhite quail corporations public and private forest owners farmers conservation groups all working together for the health of our forests and the homes of our wildlife
