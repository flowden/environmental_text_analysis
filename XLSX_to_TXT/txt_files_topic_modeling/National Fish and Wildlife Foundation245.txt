 what extes you most about working with the  like everyone my time is valuable i know my time on task there is having a big impact the foundation’s greatest asset is its position at the nexus of the conservation community we’re involved in nearly every critical conservation project in play at any time in the country and our myriad conservation partnerships connect us with potentially every us federal and state agency and ngo that’s an exting place to be and it’s the main factor that has driven me to become more involved with the foundation how will the foundation make the most of its influential position in the coming years we are leading a movement to drive accountability for sustainable conservation results using the best sence available we’re working to define evaluate and reevaluate where and how we make every conservation investment together with our partners we must make outcome based—not activitybased—initiatives part of the conservation culture nationally and even globally accountability is critical if you can’t measure the results it’s hard to justify the investment how does the drive for accountability affect the foundation’s conservation programs it’s the difference between being an investor and being a grant manager investors get a report card on their desions every day they must perform indepth analyses to make sure they are investing wisely in conservation we can’t underestimate the importance of intellectual capital which gives us the ability to adjust and change as we move toward our goals many good ideas just don’t work out smart investors know when to adjust their strategies and take a different course what’s the most important skill for a successful investor to have the hit rate among the greatest investors in the world comes in around 50— that means even the best are wrong 50 of the time what makes these investors great is their ability to manage risk they know when to cut their losses and redirect their portfolio at the foundation we are taking this same approach analyzing our investment options evaluating our outcomes and adjusting our strategies it’s a dynamic approach that i think will lead to big conservation dividends how would you persuade a potential investor to support the foundation first the breadth and scope of the foundation’s projects creates an immediate diversified portfolio for any investor and diversification means less risk plus our extreme focus on measurable outcomes and effectiveness provides the greatest single bang for your buck in wildlife and habitat conservation what’s the foundation’s potential how far can  go the foundation has unlimited potential as long as it stays true to being an outcomebased organization as we move forward we must remind our partners that intellectual capital has three times the value of finanal capital—that means we can get more from our money with smart investment desions insisting on outcomebased results and best practices increases the foundation’s leverage by a factor of three over traditional activity based conservation efforts is that what differentiates the  within the conservation community absolutely the foundation’s outcomebased approach means we’re getting involved in projects that will actually move the needle for conservation on measurably increasing fish and wildlife populations at the end of the day all of us can take comfort in knowing that we’ve committed our time and resources to something that will have a measurable meaningful impact on our environment
