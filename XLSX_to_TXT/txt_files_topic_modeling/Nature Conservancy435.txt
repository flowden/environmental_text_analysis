 conservation is challenging work nature herself challenges us to transcend our borders in favor of hers to work at a more expansive scale and to learn more about the complex interaction of natural forces that determine our ecosystems similarly we face the human challenges of economics political borders and the welfare of local communities at our projects around the world fortunately the conservancy has a history of responding well to challenges of all kinds the economic downturn we experienced last year forced some painful belttightening but it also challenged us to be more effective in how we raise and use funds despite the recession the generosity of individual donors enabled us to complete a fiveyear 14 billion capital campaign in 2003 and reflecting the increasing commitment to the global reach of our mission donations to programs outside the united states nearly doubled over those of the year before while contributions to domestic projects remained high last year we faced an unprecedented challenge in a series of media stories that questioned our conservation practices and governance we faced the challenge headon we refuted what was inaccurate but acknowledged and took swift action to correct mistakes we had made and strengthened policy to better guarantee consistent practices in all we do it was a humbling experience but we are a better wiser institution for it despite these challenges we continued to garner top ratings from groups like the american institute of philanthropy that evaluate the effiency and effectiveness of nonprofit organizations and we accomplished landmark conservation at thousands of sites in some 28 countries furthermore the conservation we and our partners undertook last year secured larger landscapes it protected river and coastal systems and it traversed borders to truly maintain the natural processes upon which we our wildlife and our ways of life depend we are proud of these achievements in 2003 we also tapped talent through out the organization to develop an ambitious 10year goal that will guide us to the most important places help us find the best partners and enable us to prescribe the right mix of conservation tools—some yet to be developed— to protect the “the last great places on earth” we also established a system to measure our true conservation success for the first time it will launch in the year ahead not long ago i found myself gazing across a landscape of rolling sunburned hills that looked beguilingly like the coast of central california where i am from but i was on the other side of the planet in komodo national park where the conservancy is partnering with indonesian park authorities and the local community on an ambitious and imaginative conservation effort the visual similarity between these two places was startling but i was struck by other less visible links in both places the conservancy and its partners have aimed high to protect vast natural landscapes and seascapes on california’s central coast we are buying key lands to head off development pressure and working with private landowners to maintain land uses compatible with natural features at komodo—within the epicenter of global marine diversity—we are helping to halt illegal “blast” and cyanide fishing at the same time we’re developing an ecologically sensitive communityrun mariculture operation to support sustainable and compati ble economic activity both projects are finding common ground to preserve biodiversity while enriching the quality of life for local people at komodo where blast fishing has been reduced by 90 percent the immediate conservation of reefs and fisheries is remarkable but for me the more hopeful and longterm reflec tion of our success could be seen in the eyes of komodo school children as they performed for a rapt group of villagers young and old using colorful puppets of their own creation—komodo dragons dolphins fishermen even tourists—the children told a story they had written about the connection between a healthy natural environ ment and their own economic wellbeing as a “measure of success” these young people’s efforts reflect the changing sentiments of the local community and its increasing commitment to conservation in scenes like this we are witnessing a wonderful transformation of the conservancy steadfastly dedicated to our mission we are building an inspiring momentum of innovation through competent risktaking increased collaboration and imaginative leveraging of resources in a year of challenges and transforming events i thank all those who supported us expressed confidence in our work and dedicated themselves to our mission as the late david packard founder of hewlettpackard and a staunch conservancy supporter said to me years ago “never look back celebrate your successes learn from your mistakes then move on get better do more” here we celebrate our recent success now let’s get better—and let’s do more—because i can think of nothing more important for our collective future than “preserving the diversity of life on earth”
