 india’s landmass supports onesixth of the world’s human population and oneeighth of the world’s biodiversity it has the highest population of the three globally iconic and threatened spees—the bengal tiger asian elephant and indian rhino india recognizes that a lowcarbon economy is fundamental to advanng human development while conserving the environment by 2050 india’s energy needs are projected to increase by 170 percent to meet the demands of its growing middle class and 200 million indians who currently lack access to electrity it has thus committed to achieve 40 percent cumulative electric power capaty from renewable energy sources by 2030 and simultaneously create an additional carbon sink of 25 billion to 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent through largescale reforestation however solar and wind power projects require 30 to 40 times more land per unit of energy generated than conventional energy sources like coal in such a context how can india ensure that its two goals do not undermine each other  has partnered with a research organization the center for study of sence technology and policy to bring forward a solution to this challenge we are using ’s development by design approach to create a desionsupport tool that uses landscapelevel conservation planning for advanng renewable energy development while avoiding impacts to sensitive natural areas we are helping the government’s renewable energy agenes in the central indian states of madhya pradesh and maharashtra to locate ideal sites for renewable energy projects that have low ecological and soal values much is at stake in this region which is the heart of india’s wildlife the two states alone support 22 percent of india’s tiger population and have the highest diversity and population of indigenous communities by demonstrating success here we can scale up landscapelevel planning for infrastructure development across the country as it experiences the most rapid infrastructure expansion in human history
