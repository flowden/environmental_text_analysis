 dear friends we live in uncertain times but there is one thing we can be sure of people need nature to survive that fundamental fact is as true today as it was when my conservation journey began half a century ago back then i worked on a ranch in wyoming taking moments to watch birds and insects listen to the wind and smell the sweetness of the tall grass i knew then that i was hooked on nature but our connection to our natural world is more than sentimental humanity depends on fresh water reliable food and a stable climate for that we need intact forests productive fisheries and healthy ecosystems at  we have always done what is right for communities and for nature — regardless of whether it is easy or conventional we invented debt for nature swaps pioneered applied conservation sence and created the biodiversity hotspot strategy we revolutionized conservation by partnering with corporations and focusing on sustaining nature for people and through your support we have thrived moving forward we need more of the change that  delivers we need more partnerships with the indigenous peoples and local communities who steward the vast majority of the earth’s biodiversity we need more relationships with influential companies to drive change across entire sectors we need more investment in the sence and technology that will enable us to stop and even reverse the degradation of the planet in short we need more ontheground action to secure the critical places and resources we all rely on — working directly with communities businesses and innovators to achieve results our message is a powerful one we know that there is a direct link between conservation and the economic wellbeing and security interests of all people and all nations we know that sustainability is essential for stable livelihoods and longterm economic growth we know that preserving nature and its benefits is an imperative not a luxury but we need to sharpen the way we share this message from amazonia to appalachia we must be able to explain how nature is the basis for improving lives we must use new sence partnerships and tools like virtual reality and soal media to share our work with people around the world we must show that protecting nature is in everyone’s enlightened selfinterest — no matter who they are or where they live i am incredibly proud to celebrate ’s 30 years of tremendous accomplishments and i am passionately optimistic for the future of our organization and our community of professionals and partners at  we have built a culture of openness grit and determination we are sustained by the wisdom and generosity of our visionary board and loyal donors like you as we face global challenges these strengths will enable us to continue to make progress together thank you for all you do for  now more than ever we appreate your steadfast commitment to protect nature everywhere because we need nature
