 sentists estimate that trillions of larval fishes died from exposure to oil and dispersants from the deepwater horizon oil spill leading to an unprecedented blow to fish populations in the gulf of mexico following ’s establishment of the gebf several gulf coast states were particularly interested in utilizing these resources to restore fish populations impacted by the spill because fishing pressure is one of the most powerful drivers of fish populations improving the responsiveness and accuracy of management tools could have a meaningful impact on fishes in the gulf of mexico starting in 2013 and culminating with a final award in 2020 the gebf provided a total of 455 million to the states of florida alabama and mississippi to enhance fisheryindependent and fisherydependent monitoring data methodologies and tools developed as a part of these efforts have promoted sustainable fisheries by informing stock assessments and providing a datadriven framework for rapid desion making between stock assessments data collected as a part of these projects have already made substantial contributions to four completed federal stock assessments gray snapper red snapper red grouper and vermilion snapper similar use of the data is expected to continue in stock assessments for years to come at the state level data and capaty provided by these efforts allowed the state of alabama to perform their first southern flounder stock assessment which resulted in important changes to catch limits ensuring the longterm sustainability of the spees beyond stock assessment tools developed and implemented as a part of these projects — including florida’s gulf reef fish survey alabama’s snapper check and mississippi’s tails ‘n scales — have allowed each state to more accurately estimate recreational fisheries catch and effort improving their management of fishing season lengths monitoring data collected as a part of these efforts also falitated a timely assessment of the impact of the 2018 florida red tide on red grouper and informed mitigation strategies that will allow the population to recover highlights of these efforts were the focus of a report prepared by  state and federal fisheries managers and researchers that was released in late 2020
