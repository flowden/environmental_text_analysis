 go for kyoto on 7 february 200 days before governments gathered in johannesburg for the world summit on sustainable developmentlaunched “go for kyoto” a campaign to speed up ratification of the kyoto climate treaty and bring it into force before the end of 2002 argues that without a legal and binding treaty to stabilize climate change efforts towards sustainable development will be in vain by august 74 countries including japan and the eu member states – responsible for 36 per cent of green house gas emissions – had approved the treaty ratification by countries emitting a total of 55 per cent would see the treaty become international law with the us the world’s biggest co2 polluter refusing to partipate  campaigned hardest for key countries such as canada and russia to join during a visit to germany russian president putin was challenged by  activists to approve the climate treaty the following day the russian government began the process of ratification by the duma only canada now lagged behind although the canadian prime minister pledged to ratify before the end of the year melting away ’s climate change programme continues to lead the field in docu menting and publizing the impacts of climate change on biodiversity a new study by  polar bears at risk confirms that climate change is the number one longterm threat to the survival of the world’s remaining 22000 bears global warming has caused arctic temperatures to rise by 5˚ c over the past 100 years and the extent of sea ice has decreased by 6 per cent over the past 20 years sentists now predict a 60 per cent loss of summer sea ice by around 2050 which would more than double the icefree season from 60 to 150 days sea ice is critical to polar bears as a platform from which they hunt their prey mainly seals longer icefree periods limit the time the bears have to hunt redung the female bears’ ability to feed their young the  report found evidence that global warming is already affecting polar bears in the hudson bay area of canada one of the leading co2 polluters yet to ratify the kyoto climate treatythis comes on top of problems that polar bears already face from hunting toxic pollution and future oil developments in the arctic a new  website – wwwpanda orgpolarbears – contains extensive information about polar bears and their arctic domainand includes satel litetracking of two bears as they roam the ice pack in search of prey green electrity a new scheme developed by  and other environmental and consumer organizations is promoting common standards in europe for “green” elec trity – energy generated from clean renewable sources like wind turbines and solar powerthe european green electrity network eugene aims to bring together under one ecolabel the various green energy schemes that currently exist in europe with strong promotion by  germany has become the fastest growing “green energy economy” in the world creating almost 3 per cent of its entire electrity from wind the country’s labourintensive renewable energy sector employs more than 60000 people – higher than the nuclear industry with 40000 employees – contributing 35 per cent of national energy requirementsthe european commis sion wants to double renewable energy production in the eu by 2010 in june  started a campaign to promote green electrity in five countries – france germany italy spain and the uk – that together account for threequarters of the eu’s power productionthe campaign launch was accompanied by a  report which showed that by buying green electrity europe’s businesses and public institutions could cut their co2 emissions by 20 million tonnes per year equal to the annual emissions of denmark positive labelling  together with other organizations has launched a new standard for building materials products bearing the “natureplus” label are guaranteed to be environmentally friendly and of good quality the building industry currently con sumes approximately 40 per cent of resources such as timber and minerals and is responsible for over 30 per cent of the world’s energy use in addition it uses millions of tonnes of chemicals the industry is therefore a key market for  to target in order to reduce impacts on the environment and climate products bearing the new label contain at least 85 per cent of renew able materials such as wood from well managed forests or minerals from virtually inexhaustible supplies their manufacture does not use dangerous chemicals and their productionprocessing and disposal do not cause pollution companies displaying the nature plus label come from seven european countries germany austria switzerland italy the netherlands belgium and luxembourg among the first products are insulating materials and roof tiles the product line will be expanded to include linoleum and wooden flooring paintlacquermortar and putty building the future beddington zeroenergy development bedzed is sustainability in practice situated in south london this groundbreaking energyeffient ecovillage includes some 80 homes and enough office and work space for 200 people the scheme supported by  since the project began in may 2000 was developed by the peabody trust a uk organization committed to providing highquality affordable housing for people on low incomes bedzed addresses a range of envi ronmental soal and economic con cerns for example forest stewardship counl fsc certified timber and reclaimed steel were used for construc tion and most building materials were sourced within a 60kilometre radius of the village – supporting the local economy and redung pollution by minimizing freight transport the new homes use 70 per cent less energy than conventional homes and the development collects rainwater uses water saving appliances and recycles sewage water and household waste a number of jobs have been created to maintain the village which also offers a range of community falities including solar powered cars the success of the project which is promoting 1 million sustainable homes in the ukby 2012 has led to  and its partners developing a twin bedzed ecovillage in johannesburg south africa – in what could be the beginning of a worldwide housing revolution
