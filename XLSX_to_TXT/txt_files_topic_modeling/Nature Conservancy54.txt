 at  our strength has always come from our ability to innovate and adapt we got our start by protecting land threatened by development and later moved into new areas including marine and freshwater protection as threats to our mission have changed we’ve changed too climate change rapid population growth and growing pressure on natural resources have all contributed to a time of rapid and necessary evolution at  as we respond to a rapidly changing world it’s essential that our strategies remain grounded in solid sence so we recently asked our sence team to step back and look at the big picture we asked between now and 2050 can we really have it all—a future where people get the food energy and economic growth they need without sacrifing nature good news the answer is yes if—and it’s a big “if”—we do things right two paths to do things right we need to know what we’re up against so we asked our senior sentists to establish a set of base assumptions—realistic projections for expected growth in global population gross domestic product and demand for food and energy between now and 2050 then they looked at two likely outcomes for nature and people we’ll call these “business as usual” and the “conservation pathway” the “business as usual” scenario assumes that human kind carries on as usual taking insuffient measures to save the planet this is a dire path the world warms by 3 degrees celsius—exceeding recommendations set forth in the paris agreement 5 billion people have trouble breath ing because of polluted air 84 percent of fisheries are wiped out and only 8 percent of lands are protected now let’s look at the “conservation pathway” here the sence projects a much better scenario the planet warms but not as much bad air affects some 1 billion people— much fewer but still too many all global fisheries will be sustainable and double the amount of land will be protected—a much better outcome for biodiversity at  we feel we are morally obligated to do everything we can to help the world shift from “business as usual” to the “conservation pathway” it won’t be easy but we are confident that it can be done ’s role what can  do to help put the world on the path to sustainability where can we make the biggest difference what challenges align with our experiences resources and knowhow these are the questions my colleagues across the organization have focused on over the past year in the end working with our sentists program leaders and volun teers from across the organization we settled on five priorities—the areas where  is best positioned to make a measurable and meaningful impact protect lands and waters protecting land and water at scale always has been—and always will be—our bread andbutter work it’s what brought many of us including me to  now we’re also using new tools like impact capital to unlock new sources of funding for this work and we’re using strategies like development by design to transform the way governments and businesses site design and operate infrastructure in a way that minimizes environmental harm we’re setting the bar higher than we ever have before if we do this right we’ll protect more nature in the next five years than we have in the last 66 it’s ambitious but i think we can do it tackle climate change from fieldwork to federal policy  has long been a leader in tackling climate change take for example our work protecting forests from colorado to brazil to sequester more carbon from the atmosphere we’ve also worked on restoring ecosystems like coral reefs and sand dunes to help people and nature adapt to extreme weather events and we’ve been on the ground influenng international climate negotiations but several years ago we deded we needed to do even more that’s why we’re ramping up efforts to drive smart climate and energy policy we’re using innovative finance to drive largescale investments in a wide range of naturebased climate solutions and all 50 of our us state chapters are pursuing bipartisan practical solutions for a prosperous and cleaner future provide food and water sustainably by 2050 demand for food is expected to grow by 55 percent as more people enter the middle class and transition to proteinrich diets by working with farmers ranchers fishers and water managers we think it’s possible to meet that demand in a climatesmart and environmentally friendly way in the amazon for instance we’re working throughout the production chain to demonstrate how farming and ranching can increase production without clearing more land and in fisheries around the world we are applying technology to track and ensure that catches are sustainable while creating protected areas where fisheries can recover build healthy ties urban conservation work is critical to building a more sustainable future soon threequarters of the world’s population will live in ties and we want ty residents to be on nature’s side that’s why we’re now working in 25 ties around the world to demonstrate how nature can address urban challenges—like stormwater runoff air pollution and the heat island effect—in a costeffective way we want to show desionmakers from ty hall to local businesses that nature is key to building sustainable flourishing ties connect people and nature  has always been known for our pragmatic inclusive style of conservation we’re proud of the partnerships we’ve built with businesses governments indigenous peoples and local communities but we need even more people on our side from expanding our work with the health and development sectors to engaging a greater diversity of people in our work we’re ramping up our efforts to help more people understand the many ways nature improves our lives to achieve the goals assoated with these priorities we are aligning our globally dispersed organiza tion behind them the stakes are so high that we have no choice but to ask each operating unit to make its maximum contribution to these priorities we’re coming together as never before to move ahead as one team this is what gives me great optimism as we face the challenges ahead what follows in these pages is a glimpse at actions we’ve proudly achieved in the past year toward these five priorities it’s just a sampling of the hundreds of ongoing projects in the 72 countries where we work we’re also giving you a look into the future at a handful of efforts that are just off the drawing board we want you to see the continuity of what we’re accomplishing now and how we want to push the envelope going forward as supporters of our work you are at the vanguard of moving beyond “business as usual” to a transformative “conservation pathway” where we can truly achieve our mission to protect the lands and waters on which all life depends
