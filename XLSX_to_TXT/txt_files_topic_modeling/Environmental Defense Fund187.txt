 in the gulf of mexico the commeral catch share program for red snapper which  helped design has been a huge success since the program began in 2007 the red snapper population has rebounded but recreational fishing which accounts for half the catch is not part of the program and is poorly managed leading to overfishing and large discards of fish  helped win a legal victory requiring improved management we also helped launch a twoyear pilot catch share program for headboats or large charter boats which could be a model for managing recreational fishing the results are promising with 20 boats signed up for 2015 member boats are able to take customers fishing yearround under strict catch limits while those not in the program were only able to fish nine days in 2014
