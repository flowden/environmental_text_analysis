 good birders use a filtering process to identify spees using geographic range size behavior and plumage patterns they systematically narrow the list of possibilities until they successfully identify their quarry picking conservation targets involves a similar filtering process in 2007 the bird conservation keystone forged new ground with a pioneering system to identify those spees that would become the focus of ’s conservation programs the goal is to secure the longterm survival of spees that are clearly in trouble established goals from recovery plans or other conservation documents are used to set population targets and business plans are developed to identify the most practical solutions to the spees’ problems thereby guiding ’s funding efforts over the past 15 years the partners in flight program launched by  in the early 1990s has identified the birds most in need of conservation action—allowing us to narrow the list of potential keystone initiatives from 850 to about 200 spees the next filter in the process was to determine which of the 200 spees could most benefit from  investment in some cases population increases might take so long that  grants would be impractical in others there are already many players involved and additional attention was not warranted next a more detailed costbenefit analysis was employed to estimate how much impact  investments might have finally criteria such as anllary benefits to other wildlife and a spees’ iconic status with the public and conservation community were considered from this group ’s board selects targeted spees
