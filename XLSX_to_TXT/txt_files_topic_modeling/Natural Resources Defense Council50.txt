 you help ensure that the issues  fights for are covered in major media outlets ls it difficult to interest reporters in these topics its no longer a heavy lift to persuade beat reporters to cover the climate crisis espeally when we have something new to convey whether its factual data or a fresh perspective on climate and most other environmental issues health remains the singlebest tried•and•true lever with reporters who have less experience covering our issues its helpful to provide them access to the voices and faces of real people affected by a problem we want to see highlighted we also try to instill in them a sense of competitionthat other reporters may already be on to the story and therefore they risk being scooped the most important tactic we have is to continue hammering on benefits and solutions we paint a picture of why everybody will benefit from actions that slow stop and reverse climate changehighlighting the economic gains the jobs created improved public health and personal property protected as certain political figures continue talking about the climate debate do you find yourself engaging in that debate with reporters most journalists no longer inject the he said she said false equivalence regarding climate sence into their stories thank goodness there also seems to be an almost planetary alignment helping to keep climate change a top story hearings and legislation in the house of representatives fossil fuel companies professing to support carbon pring republicans speaking out on climate action and growing support for a carbon dividend even the federal reserve is warning about the coming economic hit because of climate change undergirding all of that is the overwhelming public support for strong climate action how has the media landscape evolved in your 10 years at  to lnclude more coverage of the environment what do you consider your biggest victories in this regard the diversity and proliferation of new media outlets have become staggering in velotyits almost impossible to keep track so even with the shrinkage of mainstream media additional options like utility dive wonkette or mongabay for example provide us with a nearendless array of potential outlets for our messaging efforts when it comes to the mainstream media we continue to deploy a belt and suspenders approach targeting the top marketsthe new york times the washington post the assoated press national public radio etcand then watching the information flow downward we also target the trade press at the bottom of the media food chain and let the information bubble up you were a white house correspondent before coming to  now youre on the other side of the fence as an advocate looking for catnip did you take any lessons with you when you crossed that divide timing is everything after the waxman martkey cap andtrade bill aka the american clean energy and security act died in the senate in 2010 many environmental groups continued talking as if the bill still had life and doggedly pressed the media to cover the issue even as obama shifted his focus to healthcare reform some climate activists continued lobbying us thus coming across as clueless or in denial wjth their reputations taking something of a beating so weve learned the importance of shifting focus when you cant break through on a certain issue this often depends on an agile pivot from some news event or development whether thats an extreme weather indent or a gamechanging ipcc report the key is getting ahead of the curvealerting reporters in advance to such points of inflection and letting them know to expect input from us another example is using the united nations climate summit or the green new deal as a peg for all kinds of messaging because weve been able to sculpt coverage this way i can say that among the washington press corps  leads the pack when it comes to credibility judgment and authoritativeness
