 the people of louisville kentucky are proud of its identity as a ty of parks verdant nature courtesy of frederick law olmsted weaves through its graceful old neighborhoods because of the confluence of geography and industry it’s also a ty where the air quality is considered dangerous at least 10 days every year it’s a ty where those who live in wealthier greener neighborhoods live a decade longer than those in heavily paved neighborhoods only a few miles away and it’s a ty where rates of asthma cardiac disease and diabetes exceed national averages—so much so that the region has earned the nickname “the coronary valley” jennifer nunn is a native of louisville and is the community liaison with the institute for healthy air water and soil a key partner with  and others in the green heart project “i was born in louisville and grew up here i live in oakdale one of the neighborhoods affected by the green heart project it’s an older working class raally mixed neighborhood built after world war ii the houses are close together and there aren’t many trees except some in people’s backyards we were hard hit by the recession and recovery has been slow with lots of foreclosures and abandoned houses “i have a blended family between my partner and me we have three girls a boy and two cats i was hired for this role because i’m part of the community people here know me they know my voice—they trust me people have not been engaged like this before they may be skeptical so my presence can open doors i feel fortunate that i can now align my work with my values “we hope to demonstrate that trees can have a positive impact on people’s health but we may not see that right away people aren’t necessarily aware of the environmental problems but they all want to see a safer healthier neighborhood “planting trees creates an opportunity for the community to come together our neighborhood will look nicer people will spend more time outside it will likely improve the value of our homes my biggest hope is that people get to know one another better and the connections among people grow stronger” establishing benchmarks for a landmark study it has long been suspected that urban trees are good for people in ties we know sentifically that trees do indeed produce oxygen remove harmful particulate matter pollution from the air and reduce “heat islands” from mineralbased building materials we also know that there is an observable correlation between urban tree cover and the health and longevity of ty dwellers the maps here demonstrate what we already know the top map shows where the urban tree canopy is flourishing in louisville kentucky and where it is sporadic the middle map indicates where “heat islands” are most intense and the bottom map demonstrates the life expectancy range across the ty the green heart project area represents neighborhoods of relatively limited tree canopy high to moderate heat island effect and a lower life expectancy than much of louisville we now want to test the hypothesis that the rapid addition of trees will not only improve the local environs but also reduce particulate matter air pollution to improve the health of those who live in the project area by testing the health of 700 residents regularly over five years we will know empirically if the reforestation of ties can have a measurable positive impact on human health and wellbeing the future over the coming year  with the university of louisville and several local partners will plant as many as 8000 trees and shrubs in the ty all located in places where sence indicates they will have the most benefit for human health medical researchers with the green heart project will follow 700 people for five years testing the impact that living near nature has had on their health that data will help  shape urban planning around the world transforming ty trees from a luxury item to critical public health infrastructure trees can serve as physical barriers to pollution but they also filter fine particulate matter pollution from auto exhaust and industrial sources with their leaves trapping particles that are so tiny that they can pass directly into the bloodstream and exacerbate cardiac disease the institute for healthy air water and soil a green heart partner often compares the project to vacnation it’s preventative care ensuring that a person’s neighborhood isn’t working against their heart medication or asthma inhaler
