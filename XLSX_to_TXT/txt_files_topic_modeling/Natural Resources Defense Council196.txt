 the oil industry and federal regulators said it couldn’t happen we knew it could so when bp’s deepwater horizon oil rig exploded on april 20 2010 unleashing one of the worst environmental disasters in our nation’s history  stood ready to channel all of our available resources into action we rapidly assembled a swat team of top  experts on oceans human health communications government affairs and marine mammals to ensure a wellcoordinated and effective response throughout the spring and summer our team battled on every major front of the gulf crisis from the mississippi delta to capitol hill to advance four broad goals protecting the health of workers residents and wildlife in the gulf region holding bp accountable for the destruction that it had wrought protecting our coasts against future oil spills by strengthening government agenes and oversight and continuing the fight for clean energy polies that will significantly reduce our country’s dependence on oil only days after the blowout we dispatched sentists and communications the gulf catastrophe experts to the gulf to help protect local communities from immediate harm our health team worked closely with the environmental protection agency to improve the monitoring of air quality in the area and provided realtime information to local communities on the potential health effects of the spill and of the chemical dispersants that bp was using to try to fight it later our team worked with local leaders to strengthen the validity of the food and drug administration’s seafood risk assessments—which determine when to reopen fisheries closed due to the oil disaster—fully protect the health of vulnerable communities from toxic oil contaminants meanwhile our communications team gathered images and stories of people from the region to document the mounting toll of the disaster and we made sure that these local voices were heard in the national press “it was very helpful for  to get a firsthand look at what was happening in the gulf our experts were able to determine where government most needed to be prodded to improve its response and just how much the disaster seemed to be imperiling the environment  communications staff were very successful at using their ontheground presence to get the word out about what was at stake” said david goldston ’s director of government affairs who headed the swat team with sarah chasis director of our oceans initiative “our uptotheminute observations and insights documented in daily blog posts and media interviews were crual to countering the oil industry’s pr machine and making the broader public aware of what was really happening down there” in july  and the gulf coast fund established the gulf coast resource center in buras louisiana to falitate communication among gulf residents local groups and the media and provide opendoor access to ’s sence health policy advocacy and communications expertise meanwhile through our gulf coast recovery fund  members donated more than 125000 directly to local nonprofit groups that were helping to restore the hardesthit communities wildlife and ecosystems as we worked to support thousands of gulf residents fang the daunting challenge of recovery we leveraged ’s legal expertise and political clout to help guard against such a disaster in the future when the oil industry argued that it could still safely drill in the deep waters of the gulf we joined the obama administration in defending a moratorium on deepwater drilling in court we also filed suit over the misuse of sonic exploration in the gulf and prepared for additional legal action to ensure that endangered spees receive adequate consideration in oil companies’ plans for new drilling operations our oceans team helped compel the white house to issue stricter requirements for drilling procedures as we urged congress to pass new legislation governing where and when drilling can occur meanwhile we pressed the federal government to allow for greater sentific input in determining the full environmental impact of the spill and we fought to ensure that the 500 million bp promised for sentific research would be promptly and properly spent over the summer our multimedia team produced more than 40 short videos featuring gulf residents  experts and highprofile supporters that were viewed by millions of people our ongoing communication effort also included the publication of the first book on the gulf oil spill in deep water the anatomy of a disaster the fate of the gulf and how to end our oil addiction and a collaboration with storycorps and bridge the gulf to provide an important avenue for gulf residents to tell their own stories ultimately our nation will always be at risk for massive oil spills as long we prolong our dependence on oil with this in mind we will continue to press congress to increase fuel effiency standards for vehicles and to pass comprehensive energy legislation
