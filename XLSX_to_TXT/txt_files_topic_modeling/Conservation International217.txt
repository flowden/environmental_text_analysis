 more than a year has passed since a global pandemic transformed our lives as individuals we became more isolated than ever before but as an organization we came together with compassion and a renewed sense of purpose to achieve great outcomes in the face of an unprecedented crisis the world has not yet returned to normal it may never but we can see light at the end of the long tunnel and it illuminates the lessons of the past few months that we must always carry with us when i think about the future of our organization here is what stands out for me 1 if we ever needed a reminder of the role that nature plays in our lives the past year delivered in spades from catastrophic wildfires and storms to an economy shattering pandemic the consequences of neglecting our relationship with nature were consequential and inescapable 2 many leading companies doubled down on their commitments to carbon neutrality and sustainability showing a remarkable willingness to lead just when you might expect ceos to hit the pause button the most ambitious teams were going further faster — protecting their supply chains and antipating soetal seismic shifts i find that the greatest leaps are often made in headwinds and that’s exactly what we are seeing with companies eager to pull away from the pack 3 though inherently slow governments acted as well with 60 countries joining the high ambition coalition for nature the uk and eu putting nature firmly on the agenda and even china committing to carbon neutrality by 2060 through sweeping executive orders the united states laid out an ambitious climate agenda just in the nick of time 4 individual lifestyles changed too many of us realized that productivity does not have to mean unremitting travel others discovered or rekindled a love for the outdoors trails parks and wild areas were crowded with visitors bicycles and canoes were sold out people are becoming more engaged with the natural world overall perhaps they will become more willing to prioritize nature as well 5 and finally a longoverdue reckoning with the impact of systemic rasm and colonialism on conservation has been thrust into full view with it comes a tremendous opportunity to build a more inclusive organization and a more meritocratic movement where diversity equity and inclusion are foundational to good lasting conservation outcomes thinking about life after the pandemic it’s clear that humanity has reached an inflection point nearly every sector of soety recognizes the urgent need to equitably address our most pressing environmental challenges now we must translate that realization into desive action we at  have a critical role to play by seizing on the opportunities created by these lessons we won’t just achieve our goals we will help to lead the movement that creates a more equitable and sustainable world — one where we fully realize our potential to save nature and nature’s potential to save us all with gratitude for your steadfast support and belief in
