 most americans could probably guess from a quick tour of their own closets that china is the world’s leading producer of textiles in fact half of the clothing that americans buy is made in china but what most people don’t know is that textile manufacturing is one of the most polluting industries in the world and one of the largest industrial sources of water pollution the chinese textile industry alone creates about 3 billion tons of soot each year and a single mill can use about 200 tons of water for each ton of fabric it dyes rivers literally run red—and every other shade of the rainbow— with toxic waste from the dyeing process until recently only niche apparel brands that had built their name on sustainability paid close enough attention to environmental performance within their supply chains but thanks to ’s clean by design initiative spearheaded by linda greer ’s health program director multinational retail giants including walmart and hm are now pledging to begin work with their chinese textile suppliers to dramatically reduce their water energy and chemical use as part of ’s longstanding campaign to reduce the environmental and health impacts of runaway pollution and energy use in china  sentists teamed up with our provinal partners to conduct a study of the country’s most polluting industries we discovered that china’s textile sector is one of the two leading water polluters after conducting factfinding missions to more than a dozen chinese fabric mills and dye houses we identified opportunities for lowcost moneysaving improvements that will dramatically reduce pollution and improve effiency including better insulation improved steam management and hot water recycling meanwhile we teamed up with the counl of fashion designers of america and assembled an advisory counl of worldclass designers and industry leaders using handson studies of five mills we created a 10 best practices guide to promote improvements in textile factory performance that will reduce the environmental footprint of the industry’s global supply chain without sacrifing the bottom line the jiangsu redbud textile company a chineseowned mill that supplies walmart and other leading retailers put our best practices to the test—and the results were profound after adopting just three of the ten best practices redbud began saving 740 tons of water per day and 94 tons of coal per day the onetime cost of 72000 for implementing the improvements was recouped in cost savings in just 32 days—and the mill is now saving nearly 840000 annually according to  estimates if just 100 small and mediumsize textile mills implemented our 10 best practices china would save more than 16 million metric tons of water annually enough to provide 124 million people drinking water for a year moreover it would eliminate 1 million metric tons of carbon pollution annually—the equivalent of taking 172000 cars off the road for a year walmart has committed to begin work with chinese textile manufacturers to implement our best practices at select mills and to track water and energy savings we have reached a similar agreement with hm which operates more than 2000 stores worldwide moving forward we will continue to promote our best practices guide with multinational retailers brands and designers and to work with offials and experts in china to ensure the widespread adoption of clean by design solutions in the textile industry
