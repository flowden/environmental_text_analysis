 small steps for big conservation gains around 20 percent of the world’s coral is already gone much of what remains could be wiped out by the end of this century a  study showed that this future can be prevented with relatively small steps such as creating marine protected areas or stronger fishing regulations researchers found that when applied to coral reefs with lowtomedium human impacts these two strategies create a “coral reef first aid kit” that can have massive benefits — giving reefs a fighting chance before it’s too late deepsea discoveries with the help of underwater robots and our partners at the noaa office of ocean exploration and research sentists including ’s daniel wagner discovered three new spees of black coral in the north pafic hundreds of meters below the surface with lifespans ranging from centuries to millennia black corals are some of the longestliving animals on the planet they produce bioactive compounds that could be used to fight cancer and other diseases more time is needed to study the deep sea that’s why  has called for a minimum 10year moratorium on deepsea mining — the biggest impending threat to deepsea corals and many other vulnerable spees — to better understand its risks and ensure we avoid endangering ecosystems that are still largely unknown in 2020 we made new discoveries about coral reefs — epicenters of marine biodiversity and linchpins of economies and food security around the world — which are under grave threat from pollution overfishing and climate change
