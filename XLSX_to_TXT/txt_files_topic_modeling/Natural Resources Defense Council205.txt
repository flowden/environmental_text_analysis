 when we set out to compile our first testing the waters survey two decades ago us states and counties kept few records of pollutionrelated beach closures and the federal government kept none there was no federal or regional coordination of watertesting protocols data gathering or beach closure practices our groundbreaking report based on data painstakingly gathered by phone and postal mail from just 10 coastal states drew national attention to the lack of information available to the public on beachwater quality and the risks of waterborne illness to millions of beachgoers the us environmental protection agency state regulatory agenes and the multibillion dollar coastal tourism industry were outraged since then ’s annual testing the waters report has helped spur nationwide reforms on beachwater quality monitoring and standards as well as public notification of testing results and closures despite these strides work remains to be done to control urban runoff—a major threat to our nation’s beaches and beachgoers according to data collected from government web sites and supplemented with phone calls and emails to beach management offials nearly three quarters of the beach closings and advisories in 2009 resulted from bacteria levels exceeding health and safety standards this year’s report which included an online feature offering uptodate coverage of gulf of mexico beach closings advisories and notices in the wake of the oil disaster generated unprecedented coverage in national and local news outlets moving forward we will continue to push for better waterquality monitoring at america’s ocean bay and great lakes beaches as we promote green infrastructure and other strategies to control polluted runoff at its source
