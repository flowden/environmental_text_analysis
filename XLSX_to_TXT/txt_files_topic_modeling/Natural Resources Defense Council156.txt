 through various programs  promotes renewable energy sources conservation energy effiency and clean fuels as solutions that will reduce the impacts of climate change to minimize our own impact  measures and seeks to reduce energy use in our offices our approach is to understand our energy use work to reduce it and then monitor to ensure we have achieved reductions we conduct energy audits to identify areas of opportunity audits of new york and santa monica offices complete in fy2012 we monitor and manage energy use using systems such as lutron a lighting management system in the washington dc office and noveda a sustainability management software that monitors realtime electrity and water consumption which was implemented in new york washington chicago and santa monica in fy2013 we reduce energy use through a number of initiatives including using energystar appliances onsite solar energy  sustainability as an ethical imperative 17 in santa monica smart plugs in san fransco effient data centers in washington and new york environmental controls and hvac in washington and effient lighting in all offices our approach to renewables  recognizes that more than half of the electrity we use is derived from coal and nuclear we are working to change this in three ways 1 by working to reduce the energy we consume through energy effiency 2 by advocating that us utilities transition to a cleaner resource portfolio including energy effiency and renewable energy to reduce the carbon footprint of all electrity consumers including  3 by exploring options for direct purchases of renewable electrity for all our offices in the offices we own we have invested in onsite solar energy systems the roof of our new york office currently is equipped with a 55 kw photovoltaic solar system and our la office has a 75 kw system en3 direct energy consumption by primary energy source  owns no vehicles so heating fuel is our only direct energy consumption our new york office used 2 heating oil in fy2012 but will switch to biofuel in fy2014 our santa monica san fransco chicago and montana offices use natural gas our washington dc office uses electrity for heat so it is not included in the scope 1 energy use detailed below and our beijing office is served by district heating which is indirect consumption of energy scope 2  direct energy consumption by primary energy source fy2012 gigajoules  of total oil gigajoules 962 38 gas gigajoules 1570 62 en4 indirect energy consumption by primary source primary sources of indirect energy were estimated using disclosures from the utilities serving each of our offices we purchase offsets for all emissions from our electrity use along with our other efforts outlined in the management approach to energy in addition to the primary fuel sources in the chart below for ’s electrity consumption we used an estimated 202 gj of coal to supply hot water for heating in our beijing office en5 energy saved due to conservation and effiency improvements in our ny headquarters energy reduction measures included data center initiatives such as virtualization hotcold aisle containment and new more effient servers as well as installation of a new cooling unit using approximately 36000 kwhyear for cooling or roughly half the energy usage of the former unit printing reductions and desktop to laptop conversions further reduced energy use window replacements completed at the end of fy2011 42011 led to a 5 reduction in heating requirements in fy2012 we conducted several energy audits in our ny and la offices to determine how we can increase the energy effiency of our offices several of the recommendations from these audits were implemented in fy2012 and others were implemented in fy2013 en6 initiatives to provide energyeffient or renewable energy based products and services and reductions in energy requirements as a result of these initiatives  has placed a strong focus on decreasing total us energy use which has been going down since 2007 we are engaged in increasing energy effiency in appliances equipment and lighting additionally we have been pushing policy solutions to be implemented at all levels of government to support clean energy and economic growth  has been instrumental in driving renewable energy investment to scale by supporting finanal incentives such as tax changes to level the playing field and advanng clean energy banks to help inform commeral investors advances in energy effiency have incentivized utility companies and appliance manufacturers while saving consumers billions of dollars annually a portion of our work has focused on helping the us green building counl and leed set frameworks for incorporating effiency into buildings which account for 30 of the nation’s ghg emissions in addition the center for market innovation’s cmi – a project of  high performance tenant demonstration project portfolio is composed of several highimpact tenants including li  fung usa who are forecast to save 31 of energy use compared with codecompliant design 18 million over the 15year lease term in their new green office fitout in the empire state building cmi works to expand the impact of  by engaging with businesses to create market conditions encouraging redirection of capital flows toward sustainable uses such as energy effiency recent initiatives include a public private partnership to develop the new york ty energy effiency corporation nyceec a nonprofit tasked with catalyzing the development of a fully scaled marketdriven energy effiency retrofit industry in new york ty and our solar schools project aiming to use renewable energy to power 130000 k12 schools while increasing community awareness strategic partnerships such as ’s with major sporting organizations are instrumental in promoting our agenda to businesses and fans who attend national sporting events  has also begun expanding its clean energy efforts internationally working in china to scale up energy effiency and reduce reliance on coal and in india to promote energy effient appliances and the use of solar energy en7 initiatives to reduce nonenergy indirect energy consumption from purchasing materials and components or services such as travel commuting and subcontracted production and reductions achieved we are addressing our largest source of emissions head on by reviewing our travel policy for fy2014 to reduce emissions we have installed bike racks and showers to encourage lowcarbon commuting by our staff our procurement polies reduce embodied energy use and related carbon emissions by giving preference to products made using recycled materials
