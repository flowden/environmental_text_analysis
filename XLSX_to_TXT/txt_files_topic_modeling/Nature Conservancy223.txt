 in the largest private conservation land deal and one of the boldest conservation efforts ever undertaken in the united states the conservancy is working to reconnect fragmented lands to preserve the integrity of some of the most vital largescale wildlife habitat in north america the crown of the continent a 10millionacre complex of wild lands in western montana and southern alberta comprises some of the biggest blocks of roadless lands in the contiguous united states the conservancy and the trust for public land have purchased more than 310000 acres of land in the crown from the plum creek timber company this helps eliminate the patchwork of public and private ownership that can fracture habitat we’re also protecting vital corridors needed by wildlife for food breeding and adapting to the effects of climate change acquisition of the plum creek acreage builds on decades of conservancy action along the rocky mountain front where healthy prairies and wetlands support some of the highest densities of grizzly bears in the lower 48 states our partnerships with local ranchers have preserved this land for both wildlife and family agriculture in the blackfoot watershed 30 years of community based conservation and restoration have preserved vital valleys and wetlands the conservancy’s purchase of more than 80000 acres of private timberland was key to pioneering this communityled conservation effort
