 youre working to replace coal plants with renewable energy in the deep red states of kansas and missouri whats your approach the short answer is money if you can show stakeholders that renewables are cheaper than coal theyll make the transition the trick is revealing how expensive coal really is coal managed to look cheap for decades but only if you ignored its toll on public health climate change and other parts of our environment over the last few decades  and other groups have worked to make the price of coal reflect its true cost one tool is the clean air act which forces coal plants to install equipment aimed at redung harmful air pollution gradually tightening those standards has improved public health and helped integrate the hidden costs of coal into its price as utilities are forced to clean up their emissions at the same time the cost of renewables has declined by 90 percent over the last 10 years a how quickly is the changeover happening in the midwest kansas went from 0 percent wind power to 40 percent in 15 years and all of that renewable energy displaced coalfired power plants lf we do our job well the state could get to 70 percent wind power in the next decade and zero carbon emissions by 2035 constructing new transmission lines will also pave the way for wind power produced in kansas to cross the border a how else can the region grow its clean energy economy as the grid gets cleaner well want to transition our vehicles and buildings away from fossil fuels too well have electric cars electric hvac and electric hot water systems and well have to find ways to reduce the stress on the grid so it can handle these new demands beyond just switching over from coal to renewables a so is that where effiency comes in yes in the midwest were focused on greening the building sector if we can improve the building envelope all of the components that separate the interior and exterior and contribute to climate control much of the electrity that used to go to air conditioning can instead power electric cars wel8 working with policymakers to help push these effiency polies forward kansas ty now requires large buildings to disclose energy and water usage collecting that data is the first step toward reform st louis recently became the first midwest ty to take the next step requiring buildings to become more effient were not talking about new building its a relatively lighter lift to tighten standards on new construction instead these standards will apply to existing buildings a how did your experience with sustainability initiatives in new york help guide your work with ties in the countrys heartland from 2004 to 13  partnered on an energy policy task force in new york which helped us to develop a sustainability template that could be tailored to other ties then through the ty energy project in 2012 and the american ties climate challenge in 2018  secured funding to partner with mayors of more than 25 tiesincluding in the midwestand supply them with the expertise and attention required to do that tailoring a how did it feel to recently receive the american counl for an energyeffient economys lifetime achievement award the best part was that aceee recognized my work mentoring young advocates people cant do this work alone thats why ive always been focused on team building both inside of  and with external partners it was very touching to learn that people i mentored decades ago recommended that i be recognized for this honor
