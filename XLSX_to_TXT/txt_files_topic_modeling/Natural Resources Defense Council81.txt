 has the conversation around energy effiency changed in the golden state since you helped develop the california energy effiency coordinating committee in 2014 lara ettenson for a long time the main reason for focusing on energy effiency was energy savings—to reduce air pollution and to stop the construction of new power plants but we recognize that effiency programs like redung the cost of an effient refrigerator also have an impact on people’s comfort and pocketbooks—espeally in california where we have an affordability crisis now we’re also focused on making sure that no community lacks the incentives understanding or opportunities to upgrade their homes and small businesses and lower their energy bills our committee is coordinating among 20 diverse groups including consumer advocates labor interests soal justice organizations local governments and the state energy agenes to ensure effiency access for everyone what has the committee been tackling lately in 2018 the california public utilities commission approved the firstever set of business plans that manage the majority of the state’s energy effiency programs and required mini mum quality installation standards in addition to meeting energysavings goals programs must be designed to serve customers living in disadvantaged communities these desions set the groundwork for california to equitably transition to a clean energy economy california consistently made headlines in 2018 for picking up the federal government’s slack when it came to climate change what was the significance of two of its biggest wins a 100 percent zero greenhouse gas electrity bill and legislation related to the closure of the diablo canyon nuclear power plant these bills sb 100 and sb 1090 which  advocated for commit the state to fully eliminating carbon pollution from electrity generation before the middle of the century this becomes critical as we continue to electrify things like our cars and heaters moving away from a direct reliance on oil and gas puts pressure on the electric grid we want to make sure it’s clean and using smart technologies to be reliable likewise when diablo canyon—california’s last nuclear power plant—closes in 2025 we can rest assured that low cost zerocarbon energy will be picking up the slack rather than dirty energy that would ultimately increase emissions we also made sure that the people being affected by these polies were ensured a transition into the new sustainable economy for example through provisions funding worker retention and mitigating community impacts what can these polies teach others looking to transition to a carbonfree energy economy in many ways the state is a microcosm for the entire world given its size almost 40 million people live here economy and diversity any state or nation will be able to look to california as a model while there are still unknowns about making these goals a reality california lawmakers are committing their state to finding answers and implementing affordable clean energy solutions—in recognition that the stakes of delaying innovation are too high
