 the challenge approximately onethird the size of the continental united states the greater caribbean basin is a study in complexity whereas other ecoregions are connected by land the states countries and islands that border the caribbean are connected by water sharing currents fisheries and other aquatic resources biologically the caribbean is one of the richest places on earth its marine habitats sustain 60 spees of corals and more than 1500 spees of fish and an estimated 40 percent of its terrestrial vertebrates and plants exist nowhere else intense human pressures also make this one of the world’s most threatened places sentists estimate that less than 10 percent of the region’s original vegetation remains intact biology isn’t the only source of the caribbean basin’s unique character because the area is made up of more than 30 countries—including cuba the dominican republic haiti mexico venezuela and the united states—conservation solutions must transcend geographical and cultural borders deal with political sensitivities address differing conservation priorities and engage diverse stakeholders in a longterm largescale conservation strategy how we’re making a difference to create a sencebased conservation strategy that matches the region’s scale and complexity  has undertaken an intensive twoyear study of the greater caribbean basin addressing both the biology and the sooeconomics of the region data and tools yielded during this intense assessment will guide a stateoftheart conservation plan enabling sound pragmatic conservation desions the assessment is also deepening our strategic partnerships with local organizations—key to achieving lasting conservation results by pairing conservancy sence with the knowledge and influence of local partners we will be able to establish a common vision for the greater caribbean basin that identifies and characterizes highpriority sites and sets strategies for protecting the region’s irreplaceable terrestrial freshwater coastal and marine biodiversity
