 my favorite part of  is our tradition and practice of bringing together diverse people and finding common ground to make important things happen for nature in this regard 2015 was another strong year my colleagues and i are proud of the progress we’ve made thanks to you—our supporters partners volunteer leaders and fellow environmentalists our finanal house is in good order our team is stronger than ever and we’re pursuing an ambitious plan to address the world’s most significant environmental challenges all around the world we’re gaining momentum in our efforts to protect important ecosystems transform how people value nature and inspire greater support for conservation the following are a few examples of the successes you have made possible over the past year protect staying true to our roots we are still in the business of protecting lands rivers and oceans espeally in situations where there is extraordinary ecological significance at stake and where the scale of the opportunity is likely beyond the reach of other organizations in january for example we completed one of the biggest land deals in ’s history a 165000 acre 134 million acquisition of forests rivers and other wildlife habitat in washington and montana see page 16 the project links privately owned parcels dispersed among protected lands mostly within us national forests the “checkerboard” parcels purchased in this transaction almost certainly would have been developed otherwise we can achieve success like this only with great partners thanks to supporters open to finanal innovation we were able to secure 95 percent of the capital from impact investors through naturevest ’s new impact investment unit we will always rely on—and greatly appreate— the generous support of traditional philanthropists and now additional funding from missiondriven investors is leveraging our donors’ contributions and allowing us to accomplish much more transform transforming how soety values and uses nature means working with businesses governments and communities to help leaders develop polies and practices that support healthy natural systems because this approach relies on intellectual —not finanal—capital there’s no limit to what we can accomplish take for instance our work in nairobi kenya where we are establishing africa’s first water fund see page 26 with the help of great partners  is using this water fund mechanism—a model we pioneered 15 years ago in quito ecuador— to help kenyans transform how they manage land in the watershed of the tana river the re gion’s main source for drinking water agriculture and hydropower through the water fund downstream water users pay fees to support conservation projects that protect upstream lands improving filtration and regulation of the river’s flow it’s a winwin for nature and people the upstream conservation practices protect wildlife habitat improve water quality and supply increase agricultural yields and save downstream users money by avoiding the need for costly water treatments first across latin america and now all around the world water funds are allowing  to bring together community groups farmers and ranchers local and federal governments businesses of all sizes and fellow environmentalists to scale up ontheground conservation with multiple benefits—water security biodiversity protection and economic development inspire to scale up strategies like these we also need more people on our side that’s why we are ramping up our efforts to inspire greater support for nature—to grow that group of people who love nature and serve as its champions transformative sence will be critical to those efforts last year we continued to build close partnerships with leading universities and their sentists we can achieve success like this only with great partners the milestone project also includes acreage in the eastern cascade range of washington state snap collaborative convenes sentists policymakers and practitioners to develop practical naturebased solutions to chal lenges at the intersection of nature and human wellbeing and our naturenet sence fellows program—a collaboration with columbia cornell princeton stanford the university of pennsylvania and yale— is now in its third year of building the next generation of conservation sence leaders this year’s fellows are focusing on clean energy technology water security and sustainable agriculture on the policy front we generated great momentum on election day this past year in the united states achieving the biggest conservation funding victory in us history  worked in 19 states—both blue and red—to win bipartisan voter approval of 27 measures that dedicate more than 29 billion to the environment i’m proud of the work my colleagues and our volunteers put into making that happen but we can’t stop there those victories make me hopeful that we can break the logjam on the most pressing challenge we face climate change we have begun a 50state climate strategy that taps into our local resources to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in whatever way works best for each state it includes an alliance between  and  to accelerate the transition to clean energy rebuild the political center on climate and make natural infrastructure part of the climate solution and of course we’re also pursuing our climate agenda all around the world for instance we’re working with farmers loggers and others in tropical forest regions to implement sustainable development practices and reduce deforestation a major driver of greenhouse gas emissions and we will do everything we can—together with our partners—to help build the most robust international climate frame work possible looking forward as a sencebased nonpartisan inclusive organization that brings people together to find common ground and commonsense solutions we are well positioned to protect vital habitats transform the way soety values and invests in nature and inspire and broaden the constituency for conservation none of this will be easy but i believe there is reason to be optimistic  can be an effective force for change in the conservation movement by bringing together people and organizations with diverse views and encouraging them to set aside their differences learn from one another and work collaboratively toward shared goals together we can accelerate progress on the world’s most pressing environmental challenges thank you again for all that you do to help us con serve the lands and waters on which all life depends
