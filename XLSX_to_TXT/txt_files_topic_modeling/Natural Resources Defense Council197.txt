 years before the bp oil disaster two major commissions warned that our oceans—including the gulf of mexico—were in a state of silent collapse on top of longstanding stressors such as pollution underwater noise overfishing and unsound coastal development daunting new challenges are putting coastal ecosystems marine life and the economy at grave risk ocean adification caused by mounting carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere has potentially serious implications for the entire ocean food chain including commerally important seafood but president obama provided new hope for our ocean realm in july 2010 by issuing an executive order establishing a comprehensive national policy for our oceans coasts and great lakes while the gulf oil spill gave the president’s historic move a fresh sense of urgency  and our partners had long been promoting the adoption of a seminal environmental policy for protecting maintaining and restoring ocean health after the president assembled an interagency task force in 2009 to develop an oceans policy and a plan to implement it we helped lead the effort among national regional and local conservation groups to formulate and submit strong sencebased recommendations the adoption of this key policy marks a critical shift in thinking about our seas not as a bottomless treasure chest to be plundered but as a critically endangered resource on which countless lives and livelihoods across the globe depend america’s firstever oceans policy provides a coherent national vision for managing daytoday threats to our ocean ecosystems as well as new approaches designed to protect sensitive areas from an environmental and economic catastrophe like the gulf oil spill among the new policy’s reforms is a requirement that the more than 20 federal agenes that oversee activities affecting our ocean resources—and have historically operated with different goals and conflicting mandates—coordinate their efforts to ensure ocean protection effective immediately each of these agenes must consider desions it makes in the context of their cumulative impacts on ocean health moving forward an interagency national ocean counl will help oversee the policy’s implementation including the development of nine action plans to address priority ocean issues over the coming year  will be working to promote and monitor the development of several of these action plans covering urgent issues such as ocean adification meanwhile we will be making detailed recommendations as another key provision of the policy is implemented the creation over the next several years of regional coastal and marine plans these sencebased plans which will be developed for the different ocean regions of the country by joint federalstate planning bodies with public input will provide a blueprint to guide ocean activities from unsuitable to suitable areas this planning will provide greater certainty for developers we will be working to ensure that these plans protect sensitive areas and the overall health of ocean ecosystem upon which we depend for food medines climate regulation and the very air we breathe
