 more than a generation has passed since the us food and drug administration first recognized that feeding livestock low doses of certain antibiotics could promote “superbugs”—antibiotic resistant bacteria capable of infecting people yet the fda bowing to pressure from the livestock and pharmaceutical industries has failed to take the necessary steps to ensure that antibiotics continue to work when we need them most when our families are ill this year backed by the conclusions of the world’s leading medical sentific and public health organizations  and our partners filed a lawsuit to force the fda to follow its own safety findings and withdraw approval for most nontherapeutic uses of penillin and tetracyclines in animal feed a staggering 80 percent of antibiotics sold in the united states are consumed by livestock animals the antibiotics which are mixed into feed or water for pigs cows chickens and turkeys to promote faster weight gain and compensate for unsanitary living conditions are used at levels too low to treat disease making bacteria more resistant to medical treatment the institute of medine of the national academies of sence has warned that if antibiotic resistance is not addressed “the specter of untreatable infections—a regression to the preantibiotic era—is looming just around the corner” the fda has shut its eyes to this horrifying scenario following a lawsuit that challenged the fda’s lack of action the agency responded to tizen petitions on this critical issue—the first of which was filed in 1999 even then it moved only to recommend that livestock operations voluntarily stop the unnecessary use of antibiotics in september 2011 the american medical assoation the american academy of pediatrics and other leading health groups sent a letter urging congress the white house and the fda to take immediate action in light of clear sentific evidence linking the misuse and overuse of antibiotics in food animals and the spread of antibiotic resistance the same month a report released by the us government accountability office found that federal agenes including the fda have made only “limited progress” in addressing antibiotic use in animals by focusing on good hygiene and improved management practices a fality can dramatically reduce illness among livestock and in turn the need for antibiotics in fact all 27 countries in the european union have already stopped using antibiotics to promote growth and increase production thereby redung the indence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in meat  is making sure that america is next in line
