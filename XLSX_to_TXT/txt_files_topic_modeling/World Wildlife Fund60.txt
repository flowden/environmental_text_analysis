 floodwaters with nowhere to go as floodwaters rose in europe and other parts of the world during the summer of 2002 bringing death and destruction to people livestock and homes  pointed to climate change as one of the leading causes of the increasing frequency of violent weather events however  also pointed out that poor management of freshwater ecosystems plays a crual role during the last 150 years flood plains – lowlying areas of land adjacent to rivers lakes and coasts – have been drained on a massive scale to make way for agriculture and urban and industrial developmentin times of flood rivers spread out over floodplains which in their natural state act as giant sponges where they have been destroyed floodwater is channelled into unnaturally small spaces often with sudden and catastrophic results in times of extreme weather as floodrelated insurance claims continue to rise – us25 billion was paid out worldwide in 2000 – the industry is beginning to refuse protection for homes and buildings built in floodplain areas a  study along the rhine estimated that the annual cost of treating drinking water and building flood protection barriers and other services that the river’s floodplains used to provide for free is as much as us2 billion  argues that the enormous economic and soal cost of flooding could be prevented by restoring floodplains to a more natural state boost for china’s wetlands population growth and rapid economic development in china have resulted in a large number of wetlands in the eastern part of the country being drained and converted to farmlandwith increas ing pressure on remaining natural areas  was instrumental in bringing about the launch on 2 february – world wetlands day – of a huge wetland conservation programme by the chinese governmentthe organization celebrated this move as a significant gift to the earth see page 5 which will greatly benefit the whole country over the next ten years china will invest us1 billion to set up more than 200 new wetland protected areas securing the future of some 20 million hectares protecting the niger river freshwater conservation in west africa took a leap forward in february when the government of guinea designated more than 45 million hectares of wetlands for protection under the ramsar convention – a treaty signed by more than 130 countries the newly protected wetlands – the second largest in africa after botswana’s okavango delta – include the source of the niger river which rises on the fouta djallon highlands in guinea more than 250 spees of freshwater fish live in the 4180kiloetre long riverof these20 spees are endemic – found nowhere else in the world the move followed ’s forceful lobbying of governments to protect their mountain wetlands in the context of the un“international year of mountains” the niger is at the heart of ’s activities in west africa which aim to strengthen the conservation and sustainable management of freshwater wetlands guinea’s announcement is a major step towards achieving the organization’s objectives “africa is making great strides in the protection of its freshwater sources and  is part of the solution working with committed partners on a freshwater crisis that touches not just africa but the whole world” said sarah humphrey’s freshwater officer for africa and madagascar cold water pollution cold water released from large dams is posing a major threat to australia’s rivers according to research undertaken in the murray darling basin by  and australia’s inland rivers network the two organizations are urging the federal and state governments to take immediate action to control the problem cold water pollution occurs when water is released from valves at the bottom of dams to meet downstream agricultural industrial and domestic use studies have shown that thermal pollution can occur for up to 300 kilometres downstream from dams with temperatures frequently well below natural levelsin spring and summer water stored in deep dams forms layers with a surface layer warmed by the sun overlying a cold bottom layer when water is released from the dam a slug of unnaturally cold water is releasedthe resulting cold water pollution can kill fish eggs and larvae and cause localized extinction of some spees recreational fishing is an important tourism asset for many small riverside towns and the loss of fish through cold water pollution can severely affect rural economies over 2500 kilometres of major rivers in new south wales are estimated to be seriously affected
