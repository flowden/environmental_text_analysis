 after years of ’s leadership—and collaboration with all those who have a stake in protecting coastal waters— the california fish and game commission voted on december 15 to adopt a network of marine protected areas mpas off california’s south coast this network of “yosemites of the sea” where ocean wildlife can recover and multiply will stretch from santa barbara to the mexicous border the new mpas build on northern channel islands protections adopted in 2002 the central coast in 2007 and the north central coast in 2009 and constitute the southern portion of the statewide underwater park system envisioned by california’s marine life protection act of 1999 these marine protected areas are designed to foster healthy ocean habitats and natural diversity and to help restore the lost abundance of california fisheries the final south coast mpa network doubles the number of marine protected areas in southern california—including key ecological areas such as naples reef point dume and la jolla and represents hundreds of hours of outreach and public meetings attention next turned to the mlpa implementation process in the north coast region  is working hard to find common ground with fishermen tribal representatives and other key stakeholders underscoring our leadership in the implementation of the mlpa our north coast representative was appointed to the regional stakeholder group—making us the only conservation organization to have served on all four mlpa regional stakeholder groups the longterm challenge in california is to ensure that implementation of the mlpa is adequately funded efforts to provide a dedicated revenue stream via a state ballot initiative were defeated by voters in november but our commitment to securing the resources that are needed to provide future generations of californians—and all americans—with the full benefits of the mlpa process will continue
