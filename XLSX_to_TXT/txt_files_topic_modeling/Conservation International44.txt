 “why cut down a tree a tree is your life” says segundo guevara segundo is a farmer working with  in peru’s alto mayo protected forest working with farmers like segundo and with the country’s national and regional governments we’re demonstrating that poor communities can improve their wellbeing—without destroying the rainforests that sustain all life on earth we know some of the impacts that happen when the alto mayo protected forest which covers more than 182000 hectares 450000 acres in the peruvian amazon is not sustainably managed critical “services” provided by the forest—including crop pollination carbon storage and fresh water that runs from the mayo river—are put at risk already deforestation has increased sediment in the river and slowed its flow threatening the supply of fresh water that sustains lives nourishes crops and supplies hydropower particularly to the lowlands addressing the forces that drive deforestation and maintaining the forest’s lifesustaining benefits are at the root of ’s partnership with the ministry of environment of peru the country’s national service of natural protected areas the regional government of san martin and other local groups although the peruvian government designated the alto mayo protected forest as a protected area in 1987 the resources needed to enforce protection have been lacking people have long settled in the area illegally clearing land for agriculture housing and other needs construction of a road in the area has encouraged more settlers in recent years with the number of residents in the alto mayo basin now reaching nearly 220000 the area suffers some of the highest poverty rates in the region agriculture comprises 30 percent of the region’s economic activity with coffee as the main product one common problem occurs when coffee farmers lack the needed information and tools to optimize their practices plots become infertile so farmers cut down more trees to plant in new areas cumulatively these activities add up to significant deforestation and loss of the forest’s natural benefits that people depend on five years ago  teamed up with the walt disney company to address the underlying drivers of deforestation and help local communities develop through this model we have entered into conservation agreements with more than 300 coffee farming families in the alto mayo in exchange for agreeing to stop clearcutting and helping restore degraded lands farmers receive training to improve their longterm crop yields such as how to grow coffee in the shade make organic compost and treat fungi that affect tree health the families also receive farming equipment medical supplies educational materials and jobs patrolling the forest when segundo guevara who has grown coffee since he was 16 moved his family into the alto mayo he was unaware of the area’s protected status like many of the alto mayo’s settlers he purchased a few acres of land without realizing that no legal title came with it to plant coffee and other crops segundo cleared land by burning forest when he learned that his activities were not only failing to optimize his yields but also contributing to widespread deforestation he entered into a conservation agreement with  in addition to converting to sustainable farming practices segundo now contributes to reforestation efforts with his family at a community tree nursery  has been working with the peruvian government to allow current residents like segundo and his family to remain on the land as protectors of the forest the scale of impact however goes far beyond segundo and his family in november 2012 the alto mayo project was successfully validated and achieved gold level certification under the world’s leading standards the verified carbon standard and the climate community and biodiversity standards through an independent audit the verification confirmed that the project has generated more than 25 million metric tons of emissions reductions between 20092012—the equivalent of taking over 500000 cars off the road for a year with funding from usaid in 2013 we are extending these efforts we also signed an agreement with the national park service of peru to comanage the alto mayo protected forest for the next five years helping to protect the forest against threats like the extraction of forest resources the alto mayo pilot initiative is showing how putting a value on the benefits that nature provides can be an important tool for funding work to bolster communities’ economic security while conserving the natural resources they rely upon segundo reports that since implementing the new sustainable farming techniques both his crop production and income have improved “it’s always good to take care of the forest so the animals don’t leave and the water doesn’t go away” he says “if not we would be harming our children”
