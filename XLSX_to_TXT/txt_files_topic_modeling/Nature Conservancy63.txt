 nearly 60 percent of all fisheries around the world are being overfished or are in decline marine wildlife—particularly vulnerable animals like sharks rays seabirds turtles and marine mammals—and the habitats on which they depend are also in steep decline in addition fish and other seafood are a vital source of key nutrients for more than 31 billion people and provide direct or indirect livelihoods for 10 to 12 percent of the world’s population despite our dependence on the oceans for food we know very little about how many fish remain in the sea thomas kraft is a founder of norpac fisheries export a successful processing and distribution business dedi cated to accountability responsibility traceability and sustainability he is a partner with  in its efforts to employ traceability methods in pafic fisheries “my background is as a cpa i didn’t initially plan to work in the seafood industry i got into it because i grew up in the pafic northwest and was always interested in marine resources and i had a client in the seafood industry i began by developing a swordfish export operation in hawaii back when there were few regulations i witnessed the depletion of several local fisheries and the threats to cetaceans and sea turtles and came to realize that i was part of the problem but hadn’t even realized it “that led me to develop a fishtraceability system in 2004 our system can tell you where any given fish came from who has handled it how long it’s been in our fality and where it’s going when i was looking to expand my work i wanted to avoid what i had experienced in hawaii and i ended up talking with ’s chuck cook and peter maus “we were able to apply our traceability system to begin a fisheries improvement project in indonesia this is the first time a fisheries improvement project has taken a multispees approach to collect data and involve local fishers managers processors distributors local hotels and customers abroad to create an endtoend stakeholder chain of interested parties who are willing to work together to drive the economics so that everybody’s aware and can make rational desions for the benefit of the fishery it links the economics to the biologic and environmental in a costeffective way” the future  is driving innovative solutions with communities fishers managers and policymakers  and partners from the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the commonwealth sentific and industrial research organisation csiro and the sence for nature and people partnership snapp have been working together with leading stock assessment sentists to develop a userfriendly application called fishpath the fishpath desionsupport platform combines all the lessons learned from past fisheries management efforts across the globe—the first time all this information has been synthesized in one place and turned into practical advice for managers spefically it guides the user in identifying the appropriate monitoring assessment and management options for a spefic fishery given its sooeconomic and governance context goals and needs but 90 percent of global fisheries operate with no sentific assessment of their health current methods of collecting data are cumbersome and expensive spefic to pafic tuna fisheries  is rolling out electronic monitoring technology to improve oversight using motion sensors and gps systems with cameras government and industry players can see what spees are being brought on board these investments not only provide a lifeline to an ailing ecosystem but also help regional leaders create more informed—and more sustainable—fishery polies this multifaceted approach will help stabilize regional ecosystems protect the world’s tuna supply and preserve local cultural traditions putting that electronic monitoring on board boats solves one problem lack of data but creates a new one too much data reviewing thousands of hours of footage is cumbersome and expensive ’s california program long a pioneer in coastal fisheries innovation engaged the technology industry to bring the same expertise that helps facebook tag your friends to solve the data overload by holding a firstever artifial intelligence competition for top data sentists  spurred thousands of teams to develop algorithms designed to identify when a fish is caught and what type of fish it is the conservancy then worked with software and electronic monitoring vendors to get the winning solution into the fishery as these algorithms are exposed to more data the accuracy will continually improve  is making the algorithm code available under an opensource license that will enable anyone to use the algorithms freely
