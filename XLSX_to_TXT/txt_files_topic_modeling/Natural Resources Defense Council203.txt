 consider for a moment how much sentists have learned since 1976 about the effects of toxic chemicals on human health then imagine that the federal law designed to protect the public from toxic chemicals had remained unchanged since 1976 despite these advances it’s hard to believe but it’s true as recently as two years ago america’s toxic substances control act a our nation’s bedrock chemical control law was moldering—all but forgotten by washington policymakers since its adoption more than three decades ago  and other groups toiled for more than a decade to pass state level bans on toxic chemicals until 2009 when the obama administration made overhauling a one of its national environmental priorities across capitol hill our policy experts met with key congressional staffers and distributed fact sheets and other materials highlighting the need to address the potential health risks of tens of thousands of chemicals currently in use—and of the new chemicals entering the marketplace each year for instance the environmental protection agency epa still lacks the authority it needs to ban the use of asbestos a wellknown carnogen in most consumer products meanwhile  sentists testified at congressional hearings and contributed to a groundbreaking report cataloging the latest research on the links between chemical exposure and serious health problems including cancer asthma and birth defects thanks to our powerful campaign a strong a reform bill was introduced in the house of representatives in july 2010 the toxic chemicals safety act will enhance the epa’s authority and responsibility to regulate toxic chemicals both those we already know are unsafe and those that require additional testing it will also expand the public’s right to know about the health and environmental impacts of chemicals on the market as well as where those chemicals are used and how people are likely to be exposed crually the bill shifts the burden of proof from the epa to the chemical industry in demonstrating whether a chemical is safe to enter or remain on the market as chemical industry proponents maneuver to block this longoverdue legislation we will be mobilizing hundreds of thousands of concerned americans to keep up the pressure on congress until it takes meaningful action to rein in dangerous chemicals
