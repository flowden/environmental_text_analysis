 in fastchanging rural america existing tools for protecting wildlife can no longer preserve habitat on a large enough scale dozens of spees slip closer to extinction as conflicts between developers landowners and conservationists escalate nowhere is the urgency greater than in the west where the oil and gas boom threatens a shy bird that symbolizes the western prairie—the greater sage grouse in 2015 the us fish and wildlife service considered listing the sage grouse under the endangered spees act a move that would have triggered costly legal battles throughout the bird’s 11state range without any guaranteed benefit for the bird  had a different idea we developed incentives for private landowners industry and conservationists to share resources so that everyone wins including the sage grouse with  habitat exchanges ranchers and farmers are paid to improve habitat on their working lands and to play host to appropriate wildlife—much the way airbnb lets homeowners get paid for taking in travelers a company that degrades habitat is required to fund the creation of enough betterquality terrain to more than compensate for the damage it causes  sentists helped develop a reliable way to gauge the impacts and benefits to the grouse impressed by the program colorado governor john hickenlooper helped  develop an exchange for sage grouse “it’s inspiring to see colorado ranchers conservationists and business leaders come together for this iconic bird” the governor said colorado nevada and the federal bureau of land management now recognize habitat exchanges as a way to save imperiled spees without onerous regulations by mid2015  and its partners won enough restoration commitments from ranchers to persuade the fish and wildlife service that a sage grouse listing is not warranted “securing the future of the sage grouse without having to resort to the endangered spees act’s safety net is a win for wildlife and people across the west” says fish and wildlife service director dan ashe “i never thought i would be so happy and so proud to hear the words ‘not warranted’”
