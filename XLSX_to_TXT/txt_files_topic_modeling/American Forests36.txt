 2014 was another year of milestones for  with the support of our members and corporate partners we planted our 47 millionth tree taken together these trees planted since our global releaf program began in 1990 have removed millions of tons of carbon from the earthâ€™s atmosphere each year the amount of co2 sequestered continues to grow as the trees grow but removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere is only one benefit in 2014 we worked with local partners to plant trees along waterways and in major watersheds from detroit to cameroon ensuring hope for a future with cleaner water we have helped restore thousands of acres of habitat and food sources for wildlife including threatened and endangered spees from wood storks to grizzlies and gopher tortoises to spotted owls the net effect of this work can be measured tree by tree or spees by spees but the big picture is that we are helping to restore ecosystems that are critical to all life on the planet
