 coral reefs repopulate naturally as threats are reduced but many severely degraded reefs have lost their ability to recover naturally in 2020 we added a new emphasis on increasing capaty for direct replanting efforts on reefs where the threats have been reduced enough to promote growth our grantees are establishing nurseries and techniques to increase the survivorship of outplants so that largescale restoration efforts are possible restored and enhanced reefs will serve as footholds of biodiversity and sources of brood stock that will help replenish and recover nearby reefs after episodic events our 2020 grantmaking focused on support for the mission iconic reefs effort in the florida keys which will be the nationâ€™s largest coral reef restoration ever attempted grant examples include a grant of 169000 to the florida aquarium will increase genetic diversity of coral spees and develop a nursery stock of urchins a primary herbivore to be used in the broader restoration effort in the florida keys researchers at the university of florida will use a grant of 149000 to fieldtest management interventions to address local threats to coral restoration success such as predation from snails in florida a grant of 100000 will enable the coral restoration foundation to support active coral restoration at four sites in the florida keys to benefit endangered coral spees project will improve 28 acres of reef habitat through increased coral propagation and direct reef restoration
