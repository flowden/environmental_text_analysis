 despite decades of effort existing tools to protect america’s rarest animals are not saving habitat fast enough to restore healthy populations as many as 91 spees of birds— including the whooping crane—are threatened with extinction the key to recovery for many of these spees lies with america’s private farm ranch and forest landowners who manage twothirds of our nation’s land  has created powerful incentives for these landowners to embrace conservation without onerous regulations with  habitat exchanges landowners are paid to maintain and improve habitat the payments come from energy companies required to mitigate the damage they cause to lesserquality habitat nowhere is the urgency to save spees greater than in the 16 western states where two iconic rangeland birds the greater sagegrouse and lesser prairiechicken nest in sagebrush and grasslands the birds’ shrinking habitat is home to the region’s largest economic engines— ranching and energy development in 2014 the us fish and wildlife service listed the prairiechicken as threatened under the endangered spees act now the agency faces a 2015 deadline to dede if the sagegrouse is to be similarly protected federal listing could severely crimp energy production and ranching across many states and trigger prolonged court battles with an uncertain outcome for the bird  is working to recover the prairiechicken by establishing a habitat exchange in the great plains similar efforts are under way for the sagegrouse in colorado and wyoming we’ll then expand our model to other states sentists will measure and verify the conservation actions taken so we can ensure wildlife receives benefits in excess of impact a company that degrades habitat will need to buy enough habitat credits to more than compensate for the harm it causes “this is the first systemic approach to conservation” says  sentist ted toombs who’s helping write the operations manual for the exchanges “we realized piecemeal conservation wasn’t saving spees” the approach builds on ’s successful program in the texas hill country that aided the endangered goldencheeked warbler in its texas breeding grounds ranchers were paid by the fort hood army base and a rare bird became a valuable asset to nurture like any other crop “by far the best feature of a habitat exchange is its collaborative nature” says colorado rancher t wright dickinson “we all realize the status quo once numbering in the millions the lesser prairiechicken known for its colorful courtship display has declined more than 90 and survives on mere remnants of its historic range 75 of threatened and endangered spees are found on private land wasn’t working  came along at the right time they put an end to the conflict industry that had accomplished little actual conservation”
