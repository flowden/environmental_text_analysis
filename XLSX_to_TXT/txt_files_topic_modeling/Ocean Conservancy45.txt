 celebrated a successful completion of californias network of underwater parks early 2013 brought us to a successful completion of a decadelong project to create californias network of underwater parkscovering 850 square miles of diverse representative habitats of californias coastal waters during the year we shifted our focus toward encouraging residents and visitors to explore their new underwater parks convinced that building awareness about marine protected areas is critical to ensuring the permanence and effectiveness of the entire network we generated publity in multiple tourism recreation and industry publications and helped generate expanded public awareness so persona connections with the marine protected areas will help ensure their lasting success  partipated in the international marine protected areas congress in france to highlight out success in the creation of this statewide network led efforts to reauthorize and strengthen the nations fisheries law the magnusonstevens fishery conservation and management act msa has helped make the united states a global leader in ending overfishing and  has been at the forefront of the current reauthorization effort we released a report highlighting how the law has benefited fishermen and successfully prepared those fishermen to testify before congress additionally our director of ecosystem conservation programs chris dorsett became the first member of the conservation community in four years invited to testify on the topic on capitol hill as we work to defend the gains we have made we are also advocating for changes to the msa that better incorporate ecosystem considerations into fisheries management used the international coastal cleanups data collection methods to protect endangered sea turtles the international coastal cleanup remains the largest global volunteer effort to remove debris from beaches and waterways and over the last year weve also organized spaal cleanups to collect debris originating from superstorm sandy and the 2011 japan tsunami in 2013 we also began applying the cleanups debris monitoring protocol to a pilot project in wrightsville beach nc to better understand the potential impacts of ocean trash on sea turtles and identify opportunities to enhance their protection we are working to build on this project with similar work in the southeastern united states gulf of mexico central america and africa helped launch the first two regional planning bodies to engage desionmakers in smart ocean planning  continues to lead the marine conservation community in calling for sound coordinated planning for our ocean that balances competing uses such as alternative energy industrial activities and recreation thanks to our efforts the midatlantic and northeast regional ocean counls held their inaugural meetings this year—an indication of increasing commitment among federal state and tribal desionmakers to effective ocean and coastal management moreover we helped maintain previous levels of federal funding for the issue—a significant achievement amid political pressure to reduce overall federal spending successfully advocated for a halt to drilling operations in us arctic waters by highlighting shell’s error and problemriddled drilling efforts in 2012 and advocating significant reforms to improve safety  helped ensure that shell abandoned its plans to drill in us arctic waters in 2013 two other oil companies announced a suspension of their offshore activities in the region until at least 2015 these developments underscore our belief that the oil industry is not ready to drill in the arctic ocean and give us momentum as we seek protections for the most ecologically vulnerable areas amid growing threats not only from industrial activity but also from climate change produced a comprehensive atlas that provides a bigpicture view of the gulf of mexico in support of restoration efforts as restoration efforts continue in earnest following the bp deepwater horizon oil disaster  released the gulf of mexico ecosystem a coastal and marine atlas which maps key habitats and geographic features of the gulf and highlights marine wildlife critical to the ecoregion the unique atlas lauded by desionmakers helps guide our efforts as we advocate for use of restore act funds toward comprehensive sencebased restoration projects with emphasis on the marine environment on which many local economies in the gulf depend worked with partners to promote state action on ocean adification our efforts to bring attention to the impacts ocean adification has on people places and livelihoods achieved an important milestone as washington became the first state to adopt an executive order mandating action california followed by creating a sence panel to study ocean adification and sentists from oregon and washington have agreed to join maine also passed a resolution identifying adification as a threat  produced videos about people impacted by ocean adification on the east and west coasts which we used to engage desionmakers we are building on this momentum by mobilizing stakeholders and working with state leaders to demand further action
