 youve spent much of your career battling water and 400 fewer tons of chemicals reduced of motivation im convinced that the only industrial pollution why focus on textiles energy consumption by 6 percent and saved way to drive the necessary change is through the fashion industry has always had a big a total of 147 million in operating costs the radical transparency when customers can environmental footprint and the problem got top five performing mills each saved more than get information on their cell phones about worse when companies started shifting much 800000 that year the behavior of their favorite brands those of their textile manufacturing to countries companies will be motivated to fix their abroad that change created the perfect storm how have bit clothing companies responded pollution problems big potential environmental impacts with little nrocs clean by design team has had great oversight factories making textiles in china results working with target gap levi strauss how docs clean by design differ from your and other developing countries now use more and hm and were reaching out to many more previous work on industrial pollution than twice the water and energy used by similar companies this project is so interesting because im taking factories in the industrialized world many also weve learned that most clothing brands dont everything le learned during my decades at rely on toxic chemicals that are no longer allowed consider environmental performance when they  and adapting it so that it makes sense in the united states in fact the textile industry is are selecting suppliers and they tend not to have in china plus people ask me all the time what responsible for 25 percent of global chemical use an active relationship with their fabric mills im wearing that never happened when i was keeping this kind of opaque supply chain allows dr king in pestides cement or steel how docs s clean by design program them to avoid responsibility for any pollution work with factories problems that might arise from the production of after studying the chinese textile manufacturing their clothing process for a year we developed a suite of 10 to tackle this issue  is working best practices any mill can adopt to reduce its with a wonderful chinese ngo the institute environmental impact and save money these for public and environmental affairs on a improvements allow mills to be far more effient corporate transparency index some really big theyll burn less coal for heat and use less water clothing brands have terrible scores and were and fewer chemicals convinng factory owners putting pressure on those companies to take to care about their environmental footprints can responsibility for their supply chains rather than be like pushing a rock up a steep hill but redung risk having their brand reputation damaged costs gives them a competitive edge in scoring business from multinational apparel companies what is the ultimate goal of the program how effective have these strategics been in curbing pollution and saving money were seeking deep reductions in the environmental footprint created by manufacturing our clothing in china from theyve exceeded our expectations the 33 mills a technical engineering perspective this in china that completed s clean by design huge pollution problem is actually not that program in 2014 used three million fewer tons of hard to fix the real roadblock is just lack
