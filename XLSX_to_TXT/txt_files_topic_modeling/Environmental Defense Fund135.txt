 in 1966 a small group of sentists on long island began fighting to save the bald eagle and other wildlife from being wiped out by ddt they teamed up with a lawyer went to court and eventually won a us ban on the pestide it was the first great victory for the modern american environmental movement— and the birth of  almost 50 years later  remains committed to sencebased solutions in time we became the first environmental group to hire economists to work alongside our sentists lawyers and policy experts we found that if you make environmental protection pay people will invent all kinds of ways to make it happen because market forces can either hurt or help the natural world we work to get the incentives right harnessing the power of markets to reward conservation and deliver the most benefit and protection per dollar to succeed in the long run environmental solutions must be economically sustainable in a polarized world  remains resolutely nonpartisan working at the center with an ambitious pragmatic approach this gives us —and our more than one million members— a seat at the table when the big issues are being deded all in all our unique approach makes  a different kind of environmental group one of our fisherman partners rich young the former harbormaster of crescent ty ca summed it up this way “ is the first group to recognize the human dimension to the crisis” everyone wants to live in a world where the air and water are clean the people healthy and the fish and wildlife plentiful to make that world a reality  works alongside a broad range of allies including farmers ranchers fishermen corporations government offials and other nonprofit groups to build lasting solutions we know how to litigate and play tough defense— it’s our middle name after all—but we also know how to use these partnerships to drive lasting progress that’s why we created habitat exchanges a sort of airbnb for wildlife that lets landowners get paid for providing appropriate living space for animals it’s why we help farmers boost food production while using less fertilizer saving money and cutting pollution at the same time and it’s why we’ve worked with oil and gas companies to reduce leaks and venting of natural gas—which cuts waste as well as emissions of methane a potent climate pollutant our work with big companies helps drive change through entire business sectors but we accept no funding from our corporate partners because our voice must be strong and independent as we approach our 50th anniversary  is just getting started—because there’s so much to be done in this annual report you’ll find many examples of the fresh thinking that makes  a different kind of environmental group none of it could happen without your support
