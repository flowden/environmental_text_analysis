 attacking the root cause of conservation problems is a  hallmark for many freshwater fish the greatest challenge to survival is adequate water flow in the streams and rivers where they live managing flows becomes more complicated when waterways cross public and private lands that are governed by different needs and laws in the pafic northwest where concern for anadromous fish such as salmon is acute  has launched a pilot program that is engaging private landowners to help solve streamflow issues the result is a measurable increase in flow fish get water landowners receive income and the environment benefits it’s a triumph of cooperation over conflict with a healthy dose of openmarket thinking to incentivize willing landowners five years ago  and the bonneville power administration created the columbia basin water transactions program cbwtp to support innovative grassroots strategies for acquiring water rights and improving instream flows in columbia basin streams and rivers the program has invested approximately 145 million through partners to negotiate transactions with private landowners to increase streamflow the four state water regulatory agenes in the columbia basin are partners in this effort—uniting some of the most important stakeholders in the voluntary water transaction market this funding has enabled partners to use innovative transaction tools such as shortterm leases partial season leases irrigation effiency projects and complete transfers of water rights to date more than 150 openmarket transactions have been completed although reaching established flow targets and habitat restoration goals will require additional time and the concerted efforts of all stakeholders significant progress has been made on a number of key streams with ’s support increased flow targets have been fully achieved on 20 of streams where transactions have occurred on another 40 of priority streams partners have restored between onehalf to threequarters of what is needed to meet established biological flow targets  is now looking at new opportunities to replicate this model with its commitment to partnerships measurable outcomes and ongoing progress evaluation
