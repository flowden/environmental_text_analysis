 six years ago several giant global mining corporations including anglo american and rio tinto made plans to gouge a 2000footdeep openpit gold and copper mine stretching over two miles across the heart of our planet’s greatest wild salmon river system in a known earthquake zone colossal earthen dams up to 50 stories high would be built to hold back some 10 billion tons of mining waste mixed with cyanide sulfuric ad arsenic and other toxic chemicals here’s what we know virtually every major copper mine in the world has leaked and in an ecosystem with tens of millions of salmon supporting an abundance of bears whales seals and eagles even a minute increase in copper dust in the water could be devastating that’s not to mention the more than 400 million in fishing revenue generated every year and 10000 jobs for alaska’s working families that would be put at risk this is why  has continued its all handsondeck campaign to save bristol bay—one that has now outlasted the ceos of two of the international mining giants behind the project biogems defenders sent more than 267000 public comments to the epa calling on the agency to stop the pebble mine as investors in both mining companies gathered in london for their annual shareholders’ meetings  was there handdelivering more than 200000 petitions from  members and online activists calling on the companies to abandon the environmentally and finanally disastrous project  attorneys handdelivered 100000 “stop pebble” petitions from our members to the white house and we have called upon president obama to direct the epa to use its authority under the clean water act to stop the pebble mine these efforts have begun to pay off in september 2013 anglo american announced it was walking away from the project and the 541 million it has already invested and in december rio tinto announced it too was seriously reconsidering its 19 percent stake in the mine it has been said that the proposed pebble mine in alaska’s bristol bay may be the worst corporate assault on america’s natural heritage that no one’s ever heard of has continued to lead the charge against the proposed pebble mine and recently several major victories including the withdrawal of one of the mine’s major corporate partners and the the desion of another major player to reconsider its involvementmake it less likely that the mine will be built
