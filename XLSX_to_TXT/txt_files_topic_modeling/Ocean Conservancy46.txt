 when andreas merkl graduated from high school in cologne germany his father gave him 3000 deuhe marks and told him to leave out of the front door of the house and return at the back door taking the long way around andreas began his “walk about” in the united states by hitchhiking outside the arrivals terminal of new york ty’s jfk airport he made his way all over the country eventually traveling from vancouver british columbia down to los angeles by way of berkeley and santa cruz california it was in santa cruz that andreas fell in love with california’s beautiful scenery he returned to the area as an undergraduate student to “do nothing but study sence and explore the central coast” he says and eventually moved to san fransco where he has lived for the last 36 years earlier this year andreas made another longdistance – albeit far less rcuitous – move when he packed up for washington dc where he joined the  team as president and ceo andreas’ love for all things aquatic began during his youth in northern germany as a child he played along the rhine river’s beautiful embankments in willow thickets and on sandy beaches but he was never allowed to put as much as a big toe in the water – “by penalty of a very good whooping” he says – because the river was at that time a “chemical and organic cesspool” when andreas was about 10 years old people began to take notice and work to repair the environmental damage in postwar northern germany he remembers being told in 1970 that by the year 2000 there would be salmon in the rhine that period of germany’s environmental awakening was formative for him inspiring his lifelong commitment to conservation “that’s all i’ve ever done or wanted to do” he says “it’s wonderful if you find your thing when you’re 10 years old and i did i still don’t want to do anything else” a passionate diver sailor and surfer andreas has traveled the world to explore the ocean’s depths his favorite diving experience took place in the remote waters of eastern indonesia in an area where large sea snakes aggregate after approaching andreas and his wife donna the inquisitive snakes looked them in the goggles and played with their diving fins “we just danced with them for half an hour and it was magical” he says “half of you is just mesmerized by how beautiful they are and the other half is just completely terrified” andreas started his career studying environmental sence at the university of california at santa cruz where he received his undergraduate degree he continued his graduate studies at berkeley where he did more natural resource analysis and helped build the first geographic information systems or gis later he received an mba from harvard university because he wanted to better understand the “ecology of money” much of andreas’ work has been focused on environmental management including the development of marketbased incentives for responsible resource stewardship most recently he served as a prinpal at california environmental assoates a think tank and consulting firm where he worked on natural resource management issues including rightsbased fisheries and catch share programs over the years andreas has watched  closely and says that two things always struck a chord with him ’s “amazing people” and its focus on the issues that really matter before coming aboard in his new role andreas spoke with a number of experts in the field about what needs to be done in us ocean conservation and he says for the most part they agree on the top priorities these priorities – protecting the arctic ensuring comprehensive ocean planning to maximize resources for commerce recreation and conservation restoring the gulf of mexico and beginning critical work to address increasing adity levels in the ocean – all fall in line with ’s programmatic focal points andreas says his job as ceo will be to help design fund and implement programs like these that help protect a healthy ocean it’s not unlike what he was doing at california environmental assoates save for one key distinction “if you’re a consultant you think up these great ideas and then you walk out the door” he says whether or not those ideas succeed is out of your hands “for me the chance to work with ’s worldclass staff in thinking through programs around the one issue i care most about in the world and then to actually have a chance of seeing it through that’s just wonderful for me i’ve been wanting to do that for a long time”
