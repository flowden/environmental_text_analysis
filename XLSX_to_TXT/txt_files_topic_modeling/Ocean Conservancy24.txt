 five years after the bp deepwater horizon oil disaster devastated the gulf’s natural resources and communities a historic settlement this year brought significant good news—and a reminder that much work remains to be done it’s a day that i won’t forget on april 20 2010 the bp deepwater horizon oil rig exploded in the gulf of mexico taking the lives of eleven men and sinking into the ocean in a cloud of smoke and fire the bp deepwater horizon oil disaster was the largest environmental catastrophe in us history nearly five million barrels of crude oil were released into the gulf contaminating over 1300 miles of beaches and wetlands from florida to texas and threatening our creatures and our coastal way of life with over two decades of history working in the gulf  responded immediately the organization made a deeper commitment to the region and created the gulf restoration program to track impacts of the disaster and help people understand what was happening in affected gulf ecosystems— from coral reefs to salt marshes to the deep seafloor along with most of the gulf restoration program team i live on the gulf coast and saw the bp oil disaster unfold firsthand even getting access to the indent command center where the coast guard coordinated the response and cleanup effort it’s been very challenging—and at times quite painful—to see this place we love so damaged in the months and years that followed the bp oil disaster our team worked diligently to hold bp and other parties accountable and make sure any penalties paid would be used for sencebased restoration of gulf waters wildlife and communities we understood that once the well was capped and media attention ebbed gulf restoration would be a decadeslong endeavor—and one of our biggest challenges to date we emphasized the importance of repairing the environmental damage that occurred far out in the ocean where the oil impacted seabirds whales bottlenose dolphins sea turtles and many other vulnerable spees in 2012 we helped to get the restore act passed which went a long way toward making sure that penalties paid for the bp oil disaster would be allocated fairly and responsibly then earlier this year came the news that  and other advocates of the gulf had long been waiting for on july 2 2015 the us announced a settlement of all remaining claims against bp for a whopping 208 billion with 124 billion dedicated to restoring the open ocean the settlement represented a huge victory for  we had strongly advocated for a swift and fair resolution our approach has always been that comprehensive restoration—including both coastal and marine environments—is the only way that the gulf will ever be made whole now that the funding is imminent we have to ensure that any funded projects will truly restore the gulf and create a healthier ecosystem for generations to come soon after the settlement was announced the deepwater horizon trustees who are charged with restoring the damage to our natural resources released a sobering 635page summary of oil impacts in the draft programmatic damage assessment and restoration plan and programmatic environmental impact statement detailing how the ongoing danger to the gulf may be even greater than we thought the report based on five years of government research found staggering impacts an area 20 times the size of manhattan surrounding the now plugged wellhead is polluted by oil slowgrowing deepwater corals may take centuries to recover hundreds of thousands of sea turtles marine mammals and birds died the bp settlement isn’t the end of gulf restoration the oil disaster broadly injured the entire northern gulf ecosystem and many of the longterm effects are still unknown that’s why we need to stay committed to sence and make every dollar of restoration funds count the bp oil disaster was a tragedy but we are now faced with the opportunity to change the course of the gulf of mexico—using restoration as a catalyst to renew and repair the ocean coastal communities and wildlife that we all love
