 nature lovers understand the inherent value of a clear river a verdant forest gretchen daily is taking this idea a step further asking what’s the monetary value of that forest or river in terms of its ability to offset global climate change clean drinking water mitigate floods prevent soil erosion or supply other benefits and how can we capture that value and factor it into desions daily a stanford university biologist has been at the forefront of research and thinking about this concept of “ecosystem services” quantifying the value of these benefits was once only theoretical but today with the natural capital project a partnership between stanford university   and  theory is turning into practice building on pioneering work of the conservancy and  the project is engaging desionmakers worldwide—from the community level on up—to recognize the value of natural capital and reward its good stewardship adding a persuasive economic rationale to aesthetic and ethical arguments for conserving nature a major goal of the project is to make conservation attractive and commonplace—and above all relevant to people in their daytoday desion making right now conservation is seen typically as a cost—and a cost that most people can’t really afford yet what we’re showing through our proj ect is how conservation is absolutely essential to maintaining human wellbeing and to the supply of many of the ecosystem benefits we enjoy today and second that all soeties—whatever their institutions and however ‘developed’ they are however wealthy or poor—do depend critically on nature if in our project we’re successful we will make investing in nature attractive and a normal part of business by looking at ecosystems in part as capital assets “what we’re aiming to do is make natural capital concepts operational so that we’re actually making change and not just talking ideas for example one of our strategies is to develop new tools and approaches that let people actually measure the value of natural capital around them and the ecosystem services flowing from it—with an initial focus on climate stabilization through carbon sequestration and on hydrologic services of water purification basic water provision and flood control related to that we’re developing tools to implement policy changes and bring new finanal mechanisms to bear that would allow consumers of ecosystem benefits to actually pay for them this way conservation would work for people on the land—they would invest in the preservation of vital natural capital”
