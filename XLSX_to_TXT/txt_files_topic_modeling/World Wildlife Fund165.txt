 in our annual report letter we normally reflect on the year gone by and ’s many important accomplishments the organization does have much to be proud of but it would be disingenuous not to acknowledge up front a very hard truth this has been an awful year across most of the world at a time when many governments are fractured and polarized our climate is worsening and nature continues to be destroyed we’ve been beset by a global pandemic that is leaving enormous human devastation in its wake it has not been the easiest of times for us to deliver against our mission—to stop the degradation of the planet’s natural environment and build a future in which people and nature both flourish in response to the coronavirus  has been operating remotely in nearly 100 countries since the middle of march on a daily basis we are astonished at the perseverance and unity that our staff members bring—via phone calls and video meetings and more—to doing the necessary work that the world needs from us now more than ever for all of us it is clear that our mission could not be more urgent while more of the world now focuses on solving the climate crisis it is still not enough we are increasingly aware of the consequences of a simultaneous loss of nature including the demise of spees and ecosystems and the many good things they provide us that are fundamental to our lives we are faced with running out of planet as we scramble to meet humanity’s needs and we know we need to find new ways to produce more while also conserving nature around the world and are taking steps to better safeguard the people who live in the places we work spefically we have created what we believe is the strongest most prinpled approach to ensuring that local communities are at the center of our programs and that our efforts help to secure their rights and wellbeing this is a time for us to listen to learn and to act we are working hard to acquire new and necessary displines not only in how we hold safe our staff and our partners during covid19 but also in how we guarantee that we bring respect and open minds to our relationships in all our work—from the heart of the congo to the halls of congress and beyond one planet one people zoonotic could well end up being one of the top buzzwords of 2020 as the world learns more about the root cause of covid19 likely a wet market in china where live animals are sold and slaughtered we already know that many of the diseases most deadly to humans including ebola mers sars and hiv spilled over from wildlife to people we’ve identified and learned more about the connection between the destruction of forests and rivers and the quality of our air and water—and ultimately the quality of life for people and we’ve learned even more about the connection between human health and the destruction of nature particularly as it affects the most marginalized communities in the world in a meeting with president duque of colombia as part of a trip organized by  we had a conversation about how the state of the environment reflects humanity’s broken relationship with nature and the consequences that brings for all of us president duque spoke eloquently about the imperative to build a new economy and a new type of governance that brings peace not only to people but also to the natural world this reflection called to mind an earlier conversation with secretary of the smithsonian lonnie bunch who prior to that appointment spent the better part of two decades creating the smithsonian’s national museum of african american history and culture he talked about what makes that institution so unique explaining that while it was built around a single narrative centered on the history and culture of african americans the museum’s creators considered its audience to be all americans because the african american experience touches everyone what both of these conversations made plain is what we have to do across our work secure the rights of all people to a sustainable future everywhere we work from the northern great plains to the islands of indonesia the narrative of people and their dependence on the natural world is universal and it is a narrative that we need to make real and powerful in our engagement of every soety where we work listen learn act sence has always been a foundation of ’s conservation ethos we know too well the danger in making assumptions without diligent and inclusive research and so we’ve dug in on the zoonotic source of covid19 and dedicated ourselves to increasing the level of understanding of the sence of zoonotic diseases we’ve amplified the voices of people in five asian nations through a recent survey that reflected greater than 90 support for the closure of illegal and unregulated wildlife markets and worked to implement bans on the consumption of wildlife that enables diseases to “spill over” from wildlife to humans we’re engaging corporations governments indigenous leaders and other partners throughout the amazon basin and beyond on green infrastructure design making sure that all economic development and disaster recovery initiatives properly blend job creation respect for local communities and sustainability we continue to heighten awareness raise resources and develop partnerships to support conservation areas around the world helping to reverse the slide toward extinction for tigers and rhinos and elephants we keep working to reduce the harmful effects of close humanwildlife contact we engage directly with local communities to design new programs that are respectful of their rights and attuned to their needs and we continue to help build more sustainable supply chains for food from farm to table and stronger accountability to see that corporations do the right thing we cannot reflect on this year without acknowledging and sharing in the collective grief over the murders of george floyd breonna taylor ahmaud arbery and too many other black americans we spoke out about the raal injustice that has plagued our country for centuries and pledged our unqualified support for the black lives matter movement we vowed to add our influence to the fight to bring justice to those communities who for too long have not benefited from or been included in the conservation movement we are determined to find ways in our work in our communications and in our partnerships to help remedy those wrongs we have also reckoned with reports of human rights violations at the hands of government park rangers in places that we’ve supported in africa and elsewhere as a result we have taken a deep look at our work the state of the world today makes clear the need for displine and perseverance on the part of communities institutions businesses and individuals in order to safeguard the whole and we’re taking steps to guarantee that the values that guide  today—courage respect collaboration and integrity—are front and center in everything we do humility and displine this has been a terrifically challenging year for so many reasons yet the vital work of conservation marches on we are deeply grateful for the amazing people and communities with whom we work every day those partnerships have helped bring about so many successes permanently protecting some of the most essential landscapes in peru and colombia and beyond expanding bison habitat by more than 20000 acres in badlands national park raising millions of dollars for indigenous communities and others most affected by the historic amazon fires and we are grateful to ’s staff for finding creative ways to get this work done despite the limitations they face increasingly as we reflect on our work we reflect on the importance of humility and displine we need to have the humility to look in the mirror and examine ourselves to acknowledge the good things we do but also to be honest about our shortcomings and work hard to address them we need the displine to act—to jump on the best opportunities but also to identify acknowledge and act on areas for improvement and we’re taking steps to guarantee that the values that guide  today— courage respect collaboration and integrity—are front and center in everything we do the state of the world today makes clear the need for displine and perseverance on the part of communities institutions businesses and individuals in order to safeguard the whole and it makes clear that the future of conservation will be built on the connection between nature and the survival of humanity there are moments in time that disrupt our worldview this is one of them if we want to look for a silver lining to the covid19 pandemic perhaps it is this it has made undeniably clear the profoundly important relationship between nature and human health when we break our relationship with nature we do so at our own peril but when we care for nature the benefits accrue not just to the many forms of life with whom we share this planet but also to us to our families and to all of humanity
