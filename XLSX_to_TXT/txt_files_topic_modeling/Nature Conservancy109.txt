 by far the world’s leading source of lowcarbon electrity hydropower will be a key part of solutions to meet future energy demands at the same time hydropower can jeopardize the natural functions of rivers and has contributed to dramatic declines in freshwater spees its projected expansion threatens more such losses addressing this challenge requires innovative sence new approaches and a willingness by people with diverse interests to partner on solutions  is working to catalyze this collaboration by quantifying the costs of hydropower expansion as well as the benefits of a more balanced approach to energy development and rivers at the 2015 world hydropower congress in beijing in may we released the power of rivers a report showing that the global hydropower development levels projected for 2050 would fragment or negatively impact 300000 kilometers more than 186000 miles of rivers what’s more such development would disproportionately affect rivers with the greatest diversity of freshwater spees and occur in regions where people depend most directly on rivers for their food and livelihoods in the power of rivers we propose an alternative the opportunity to configure dams to reach energy objectives while minimizing negative environmental and soal impacts doing so could reduce river fragmentation by a third by arming desionmakers with sound tools and data we hope to generate better outcomes for people and nature the potential for better outcomes from hydropower development is great and the future of our rivers depends on finding innovative solutions to achieve that potential
