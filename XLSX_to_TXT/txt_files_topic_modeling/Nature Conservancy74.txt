 it’s a funny little word “and” but it’s our secret sauce it’s the core capability that makes  so distinguished and effective at delivering impact local and global the ability to straddle the grassroots and global dimensions to strategically integrate those two at scale is unprecedented with all humility it is a simple fact that no other environmental organization in the world does this as well as  people and place we have a sencebased approach driving a shared conservation agenda around the world which asserts that we can simultaneously meet the needs of humanity and the needs of nature our strategy is not to simply protect nature from people it is to enhance nature for people once again unprecedented the organization and its volunteers we are very fortunate to have outstanding people working for  the chapters the staff and the executive team—all extraordinary professionals deeply commit  ted to our mission but  would not be  without its extensive network of dedicated volunteers we simply could not deliver results without their tireless efforts with more than 1300 volunteer trustees in the countries where we work including all 50 of the united states volunteers open doors raise money and bridge the political gap that too often divides us these days last fall i experienced  in action i joined a group of trustees on capitol hill first at the office of sen mitch mcconnell of kentucky the republican majority leader appeared and explained that he had a very busy day ahead of him i said “senator we have a gift for you” “a gift” he responded “your work on the green river in kentucky saved that river” i explained as we presented him with a framed photograph of the green river flowing free after a dam and lock were removed he just looked at that photograph and smiled he’s been working with us on this project for 15 years and our work together isn’t finished—there are two more dams he wants out and a refuge he hopes we can help create he sincerely cares an hour later we were sitting in the office of sen angus king from maine an independent who was once a trustee in the maine chapter he perked up when someone said that we had just come from senator mcconnell’s office and he said “really” he could see that we were straddling these two apparently different worlds finding and nurturing common ground yet both these gentlemen both these senators both these leaders are—at their core—conservationists they both care about place their constituents care about place and they are doing what they can do in their own ways to lend a hand  brought the power of “and” into these relationships we bridged that gap because we represent the big tent join us find common ground and collaborate for the good of our communities and planet together let’s embrace nature and share the soulful experiences that unite us all at our core we witnessed the impact of common ground in action during that day in washington dc last year this is classic  bringing people together in service of our planet several months ago our first grandchild was born— grant christopher tierney this life milestone has prompted both boundless joy and deep reflection how do we respond to the generations that follow when they ask us questions like “what are you doing to help protect our environment to ensure we have clean water and healthy green ties to combat climate change” here is my answer we can say that we actively support the world’s most significant environmental organization that our dedication will not waver and we will not fail because at the end of the day what matters most are the people we love and whether or not in some way we helped leave the world better off than we found it indeed future and family may be the biggest “and” of all
