 modern soety has been through three industrial revolutions and each one has taken its toll on the environment but now there is a chance we can make up for some of that damage—through what is being referred to as the fourth industrial revolution now upon us all of the previous revolutions involved the advance of new technologies—steam and water power electrity and assembly lines computerization this new revolution is characterized by a fusion of technologies that blur the line between the physical digital and biological realms these technologies are leading to better asset management that could help regenerate the natural environment and given the speed at which the world is moving now the fourth revolution is already having impact at a rate that rapidly outpaces the previous three the conservation possibilities opened up through the fourth industrial revolution are staggering when millions of people are connected through technology a virtual community is created and communitybased conservation takes on a new meaning we saw this through apps for earth our extraordinarily successful partnership with apple that wove conservation messaging and interactive content throughout 27 apps—including some of the most popular together we raised more than 8 million for ’s global conservation work we continue to see it in our ongoing campaign against wildlife crime which combines more traditional forms of advocacy billboards magazine advertisements opeds with technology soal media campaigns online appeals to create a global community response to the black market trade in wildlife parts this global community spoke up with an unprecedented 1 million signatures on an online  petition in support of new domestic ivory trade regulations proposed by the us fish  wildlife service the regulations now in force effectively shut down the commeral ivory trade within us borders and will help dramatically reduce wildlife crime overseas the development of mermaid an openaccess webbased platform for coral reef data is helping to create a new virtual community for coral reef conservation a collaboration among  the wildlife conservation soety and the university of californiasanta barbara mermaid will let field sentists and other experts quickly upload underwater survey information this is important because collecting data on reef ecosystems is timeconsuming and the resulting data is often not uniformly recorded or presented and wildlabsnet a new digital portal created by  and partners connects sentists entrepreneurs and other conservationpassionate individuals in a central open space they can share information ideas and resources in order to identify technologyenabled solutions to some of the biggest challenges fang the planet today historically any actionable result in conservation came out of laborious timeconsuming fieldwork but the beauty of conservation is that it is a living displine so along with reinventing the notion of communitybased conservation new datacollecting and asset management technologies such as mermaid and wildlabsnet allow us to make better use of an espeally scarce resource time and as more technologies are invented and adapted with conservation applications in mind the time from knowledge to action will be shortened
