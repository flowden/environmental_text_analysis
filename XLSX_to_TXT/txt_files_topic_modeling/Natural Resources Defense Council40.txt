 nearly 20 years ago sharon bucno and a college friend outfitted themselves with a canoe camping gear and enough food for five days and set off on a float trip along utahs green river the duo paddled through labyrinth canyon making frequent stops to come ashore and explore the redrock cliffs you could go high above the river to take in breathtaking views no one and nothing in sight bucno says it was so peaceful bucno who now directs the nature programs lands division was just starting out as a lawyer at  at the time and even then she was aware of the vulnerabilities of these otherworldly canyon in the face of possible oil and gas development and mineral extraction since they are located outside of the national park boundaries they werent protected she says flash forward to march 12 2019 the day president trump signed into law a sweeping lands protection package both the senate and the house of representatives passed the bill with overwhelming majorities and congress easily had the votes to override the president if he attempted a veto the bill renamed the john d dingell jr conservation management and recreation act cmra protects lands in nearly every state it safeguards more than 13 million acres of pristine natural habitat and nearly 620 miles of rivers advocates call the cmra one of the biggest public land bills of the last quarter century more than half of the lands the cmra protects as wilderness are in utahincluding the canyons bucno admired two decades ago however tha bill doesnt address the lands at issue in litigation over bears ears and grand staircase escalante national monuments  has been working in utah for more than 30 years and has built strong relationships with local conservation advocacy groups one such partner is the southern utah wilderness alliance whose staff bucno has stood beside in court many times in efforts to block oil and gas drilling and other harmful activities this persistence and commitment to local stakeholders have long been part of the dna of  adds bucno we go someplace and were willing to stay there for the long haul she says  at the same time we keep our eyes open for the opportunity to act and seize it this is what happened with the lands bill as payoff for years of work on the ground came when the stars aligned for congress to advance the cause yet the cmra isnt perfect under a provision from senator lisa murkowski of alaska the act authorizes the privatization of hundreds of thousands of acres of federal lands in her home state see what will it take to save the last frontier page 00 these wilderness expanses could now be lostparceled off into subdivisions commerally developed or sold for mining or oil and gas drilling one more positive outcome of the cmras passage was the permanent authorization for the land and water conservation fund previously congress had failed to reauthorize the fund which provides crual grants supporting federal state and local conservation programs and it had expired as a result federal state and local agenes had fewer resources to help advance projects that would create more green space and enhance access to nature for communities still bucno doesnt expect this progress will end the fight to ensure that funding is faithfully appropriated annually  will need to continue to support that fund in part by lifting up the voices of its diverse stakeholders since bucno first floated on the green river shes come to realize that were all in this together we can no longer afford to look at issues in isolation she says what happens to our climate affects the lands we act to conserve what lands we conserve affect what happens to our climate how we treat people affects whether we can thrive together
