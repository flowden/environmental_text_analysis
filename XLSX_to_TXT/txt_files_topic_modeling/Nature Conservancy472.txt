 catalytic conservation 50 years of sparking action and hope  was born in the spirit of taking direct action — tempered by pragmatism streaked with idealism steeped in optimism the year was 1951 and there was a freshstart attitude in a post war world but the realists among the small group of ecologists who incorporated  that year recognized with a visionary outlook that natural lands long taken for granted might be casualties of the economic boom not content with idly observing — and bemoaning — the loss of an invaluable natural heritage they chose instead to act forming  “to preserve all types of wild nature” today we have honed our mission to “protect the plants animals and natural communities that represent the diversity of life on earth” but the prinples of those early leaders and the premise of their actions remain the same over the past 50 years as part of the awakening environmental movement we have led the way in cham pioning biodiversity conservation — giving definition and purpose to the concept and along the way motivating others to action as well ’s evolution over five decades has been characterized by tangible achievement and celebrated innovation — by doing things that just weren’t done at the time more our galva nizing influence in the conservation field is undeniable ➣ buying land the notion of acquiring private land as a means of protecting it was revolutionary for its time but in 1955 we began using this strategy at mianus river gorge in new york and have since helped protect 12 million acres across the united states later with the creation of our land preservation fund a revolving quickstrike fund dedicated to securing lands at risk the ability to compete in the fastpaced real estate market became our hallmark ➣ land trusts our success in turn helped fuel the local land trust movement today there are more than 1200 land trusts in the united states on the blackfeet reservation in montana and in costa rica and mexico new land trusts — the first of their kind — have with the conservancy’s assistance begun to take root ➣ partnerships early on we recognized that the magnitude and importance of our mission compelled us to work with partners initially we engaged public agenes acquiring lands and then transferring them to those agenes to be permanently managed as parks wildlife refuges and natural areas later by working with the business community we blurred the distinction between “foe” and “partner” in pursuit of conservation goals ever since we’ve engaged partners of all stripes in conservation ➣ conservation easements we helped pioneer the use of conservation easements legally binding restrictions that permanently protect lands and waters a onceobscure concept conserva tion easements are now used by public agenes and private groups throughout the united states and increasing ly in other countries ➣ biodiversity information the creation and proliferation of natural heritage programs — an unprecedented network track ing the status of important spees and natural communities throughout the americas — has been enormously influential in shaping governmental endangeredspees programs and in developing protective measures in the private sector ➣ international influence in expanding our work to 29 countries we have helped create protected areas for globally significant nat ural features — from rain forests to savannas watersheds to coral reefs — always working collaboratively with local communities so effective has this approach been that one of our partners the us agency for international development has incorporated the concept of biodiversity conservation in its mission statement we are proud of this long history of solid results derived from catalytic conservation action yet in the tradition of our founders and through an increasing realization of the importance of our mission we constantly strive to improve not just to do more but to do it better today guided by conservation by design our strategic framework for accomplishing largescale conservation we are systematically identifying the most important places around the globe that collectively embrace the full spectrum of the earth’s natural diversity from this sencedriven blueprint we and our partners are imple menting an expanding array of imaginative strategies to achieve tangible lasting results in the following pages you’ll see many examples of conservation by design at work — places where we are taking direct action where our conservation planning is being adopted by governments and local communities and where divergent interests are joining together to protect ecological systems and natural areas it is with your invaluable and generous support that we have been able to accomplish so much and with your continued support we will be able to main tain the tradition instilled by our founders of taking action to preserve the past enrich the present and inspire hope for the future there is no nobler or more enduring cause to which we can be dedicated
