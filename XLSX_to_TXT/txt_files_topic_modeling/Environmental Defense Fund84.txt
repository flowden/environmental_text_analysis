 fifty years ago eight sentists and a lawyer met on long island ny to sign papers establishing a new kind of environmental group some were ornithologists with strong evidence that the pestide ddt was causing the eggshells of ospreys to crack their novel idea was to go to court to save america’s birds of prey and they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams winning a series of legal desions that led to a nationwide ban on ddt in 1972 thanks to their work the us osprey population grew to an estimated 310000 birds by 2016 more than triple the number in 1970 and bald eagles rebounded from 15000 to 143000 what the sentists couldn’t have known was that the organization they launched that day  would remain in the vanguard of environmental advocacy for the next half century by combining the rigor of the sentific method the insights of economics and the force of law  has amassed a remarkable record of results see p 8 the founding sentists two of whom are still  trustees helped usher in the second wave of environmentalism when litigation and regulation addressed the air and water pollution plaguing mid20th century america the first wave began at the turn of the century when president theodore roosevelt created 230 million acres of national parks and reserves in the 1980s  helped usher in the third wave a strategy that built on the strengths of the first two waves while addressing their limitations this new approach tackled more than just the immediate causes of environmental degradation it delivered solutions to the underlying problems third wave practitioners wrote  president fred krupp in 1986 “recognize that behind the waste dumps and dams and power plants and pestides that threaten major environmental harm there are nearly always legitimate soal needs—and that longterm solutions lie in finding alternative ways to meet those underlying needs” this meant cooperation bipartisanship and unlikely partnerships as well as innovative polies that harnessed the power of markets to drive environmental progress that was controversial thinking at the time—but it proved so effective that many other environmental groups eventually tried similar approaches the world has reached a perilous moment the trump administration is rolling back environmental safeguards even as the impacts of climate change drive home the need for urgent action fortunately an emerging fourth wave of environmentalism can help deliver change at the pace and scale we need by using technological innovation to give people new ways to measure pollution analyze data and take action you’ll see examples of this throughout our report in response to the administration’s assault men and women around the world are affirming that environmental values are human values states ties corporations and nations are all stepping up this report shares some of the ways  is helping them advance the cause as we move with cleareyed confidence into our second halfcentury defending the environment we thank you for your steadfast support
