 the challenge in 2002 conservancy sentists at work in the forests of indonesia’s east kalimantan province made an amazing discovery a large population of orangutans the presence of these creatures offered vivid testimony to the amazing biodiversity from hornbills to gibbons sustained by indonesia’s lush but dwindling woodlands the forests the orangutans inhabit also serve as a critical source of income for local people who rely on the logging industry in fact the forests in which sentists found the orangutan colony have been awarded to timber companies for logging unfortunately unsustainable logging has taken a severe toll on indonesia’s forests and wildlife unlawfully cut wood including protected trees taken from national parks accounts for twothirds of the lumber taken annually from indonesia if unlawful practices continue indonesia’s forests will be devastated how we’re making a difference this past year the conservancy signed a joint declaration with the indonesian government and the local ministry of forestry to conserve and manage orangutan habitat key to this agreement is a pledge to protect the area’s ecology and promote the trade of certified sustainably harvested wood to support this agreement the conservancy has formed a corporateconserva tion partnership with the home depot which donated 1 million to combat illegal logging and promote sustainable forest management over the next five years the project began with a threemonth trial of a woodtracking system using bar codes to identify legally harvested timber and track it from “the stump to the store” eventually the project will be expanded to other areas to further encourage sustainable timber trade the home depot gives preference to wood certified by the forest stewardship counl the company is also researching the origins of some 50000 wood products to halt imports from endangered ecosystems the home depot’s goal is to place more sustainable products on its us shelves and generate greater consumer demand for them
