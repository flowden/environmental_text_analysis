 in december 2011 the environmental protection agency gave a very speal gift to america’s children the agency issued the first national limits on mercury arsenic and other toxic emissions from power plants this action one of the biggest public health advances in a generation will prevent up to 11000 premature deaths and 130000 asthma attacks annually working with the american lung assoation and other allies  played a key role in making the case for progress there was little time to celebrate hours after the new mercury and air toxics standards were unveiled senator james inhofe rok announced plans to block them claiming that their health benefits were “epa propaganda” our legal experts led by  general counsel vickie patton sprang into action along with our legislative team they provided analysis testified on capitol hill and worked with industry partners and states to support the rules after a tense struggle inhofe’s bill was defeated a big part of our push came from moms clean air force a band of mothers—now more than 100000 strong—that we helped launch to mobilize clean air supporters “no politian wants to make a mother angry” says the group’s leader author dominique browning mercury exposure even in small quantities can affect children’s brains and nervous systems but the mercury fight is not over it is part of a larger struggle over epa’s authority to enforce the clean air act center stage this year was the us court of appeals in washington dc where dozens of lawsuits by industry groups and others aimed to deny the agency’s power to act on global warming pollution in response  and allies—coordinated by attorney sean donahue who has successfully argued on ’s behalf before the supreme court—again worked around the clock intervening in four cases in june the court ruled unanimously in our favor affirming epa’s finding that greenhouse gases pose a danger to public health in blunt language the court declared that epa’s interpretation of the clean air act was “unambiguously correct” the judges said that the agency had based its finding on sound sence which showed for example that greenhouse gases increase groundlevel ozone worsening harmful smog the ruling clears the way for the first nationwide limits on greenhouse gas emissions from new vehicles and large new industrial sources many businesses support clean air laws but others keep pushing congress and the courts to roll them back “we can’t let down our guard” says patton “but i’m optimistic we have the law—and the public—on our side”
