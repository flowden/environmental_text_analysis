 during the trump administration’s first two years in office our judial system has often served as the last line of defense against environmental and public health rollbacks have we faced anything like this michael wall this isn’t the first administration i’ve watched take shots at the environment but the present assault is unprecedented in both scale and severity there were once areas of agreement for example every administration until now supported a department of energy program that sets energy effiency standards for appliances president reagan signed this program into law and president george h w bush strengthened it over the years energy effiency standards have saved consumers and businesses hundreds of billions of dollars on their utility bills and cut pollution yet we’ve had to sue the trump administration to compel it to implement the program to be sure we’re winning— but why should we have to sue at all what makes the trump administration so vulnerable to these lawsuits are the original laws written too solidly to undo or is the administration acting haphazardly sometimes this administration seems more interested in announng desions than in making changes that will sur­vive judial review the bedrock statutes that protect our environment have been around since the 1970s the main statute that governs how agenes reg­ulate was enacted in 1946 these laws have well­ established meanings and they limit arbitrary agency action but the trump administration doesn’t seem to care to comply that’s probably partly due to sloppiness and partly due to disdain for the rule of law in addition to threats to environmental regulations we are also seeing attacks on freedom of speech how has defend­ ing the first amendment become part of ’s mission our adversaries are increasingly try­ ing to criminalize environmental and public interest advocacy we must fight back and we have for example when powerful industry interests persuaded the wyoming legislature to criminalize the collection of environmental data on public lands we sued under the first amendment—and won the us court of appeals for the tenth rcuit which includes much of the west held that collecting data about endangered spees or pollution for advo­cacy is a part of the process of creating constitutionally protected speech just like the government couldn’t prohibit newspapers from buying ink the gov­ernment also cannot unduly burden—let alone criminalize—the collection of envi­ronmental data this kind of advocacy is at the core of our right to partipate in our democracy and winning a case like this reverberates across the country what do you feel most hopeful about as you face a mounting docket of cases against the trump administration i’m optimistic that we will continue to be successful in the courts most judges are not political they see their job as enforng the law as congress wrote it that message—law enforcement—is one we can take to judges of every political stripe and win in the courts of the united states the law matters facts matter and sence matters and the law and sence are on our side
