 the owners of historic timberlands and vast hunting properties containing some of south carolina’s best longleaf pine forests are pioneering a new approach to endangered spees management by welcoming new groups of endangered woodpeckers onto their family lands “for many people in that part of the world having these woodpeckers on their land is a point of pride” said ralph costa who formerly led the us fish and wildlife service’s redcockaded woodpecker rcw recovery effort and now serves as a project manager for rcw stakeholders “some of these folks own properties that have been in the family for generations they feel a deep connection to the land and to wildlife and they view the ability to support healthy rcw populations as a real feather in the cap it’s a sign that a piece of longleaf forest is about as healthy as it can be and that they are doing everything right from a management perspective” costa is now coordinating a groundbreaking effort to translocate woodpeckers from the frans marion national forest to carefully selected and prepared sites at a handful of nearby private properties under the state’s “safe harbor” program these new woodpeckers will give landowners more flexibility to maintain baseline populations of existing rcws in 2016 ’s longleaf stewardship fund with funding from the forestland stewards initiative awarded a grant for 110000 to the longleaf alliance to support the effort which is made surprisingly complex by the woodpecker’s interesting family life rcws one of the first spees listed under the endangered spees act are “cooperative breeders” living in extended families called groups they spend years excavating cavities in longleaf pines where they shelter and nest the woodpeckers continually bore small holes around their cavities releasing sticky resin that forms a barrier against predators primarily rat snakes rcw cavities are passed down through many generations costa and a team of field biologists must determine which new birds can be trapped and translocated without disrupting their natal group “you only have a couple of weeks to figure out who’s who in every group” costa said “it’s a monumental effort to study track trap and move these birds but in the end we’ll be giving them the two main things they’re searching for – a good home and a mate”
