 america has the resources and ingenuity to rely on 100 percent clean energy we can power our economy improve our health and curb climate change by tapping into energy that doesn’t pollute and never runs out for four decades  has made effiency the centerpiece of our energy strategy and our work has helped our country use less energy to generate more economic growth we have also helped expand america’s wind and solar power and we are pushing to clean up the power plants that drive climate change climate change doesn’t pause for partisan gridlock president obama adopts ’s plan to slash carbon emissions on a sweltering june day in washington dc president obama announced that he would use his authority under the clean air act american’s bedrock law for air quality that  helped write to direct the environmental protection agency epa to enact carbon pollution standards for our largest source of carbon pollution—power plants carbon dioxide pollution from america’s power plants would be cut by 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 and 34 percent by 2025 it was neither a simple step nor a snap desion the president’s plan is a commonsense measure and one that had been nearly two years in the making at  in 2011 fang the most anti environment house of representatives in the nation’s history and a senate that refused to take up national climate legislation  climate and clean air program director dan lashof recognized that the clean air act opened a way to clean up power plants which account for about 40 percent of our carbon footprint so  designed a statebystate approach that would allow states to set different targets for carbon reductions converging together to reach a robust national goal already the obama administration had set an overarching goal of cutting emissions by 17 percent by 2020  calculated that our plan would cut carbon pollution by 26 percent by 2020—while also generating an estimated 25 billion to 60 billion in health and climate benefits to top things off it would cost industry only about 1 percent of its revenues from there we began the work of strategically pitching the plan first there were briefings with government offials hill staffers business executives and utilities representatives then we announced ’s carbon slashing plan at the national press club—the biggest venue in town—with a blueribbon panel of independent experts utility executives business leaders and public health offials to provide supporting statements and as reporters administration offials and hill staffers woke up on the morning of our announcement a carefully timed and embargoed story in bloomberg news gave outside credibility to our plan within hours the story was picked up by the assoated press and reuters and ran throughout the country then  staff took our message to capitol hill to drum up support if and when the president adopted our plan one white house staffer contacted  after a few months and asked “are you guys behind this everywhere we go the president is being asked about climate change” meanwhile  ran soal media campaigns urging members and online activists to tell the white house to act on climate change in early june we launched a major advertising blitz with spots during sunday talk shows and takeovers on the homepage of politico national journal and washington post mobile apps with a video featuring  trustee robert rord asking tizens to push the president to live up to his promise on climate change and make dirty power plants clean up their carbon pollution a welltimed meeting between  president frances beinecke and white house chief of staff denis mcdonough made it clear that the president needed to adopt a concrete plan to tackle climate change—and soon she told him the environmental community was growing impatient with inaction by the end of june 2013 the president had announced a plan to reduce carbon emissions at existing power plants the approach was familiar—one that would allow statebystate development of standards within a national framework that afternoon the new york times ran an article that the president’s approach to cutting carbon pollution “appears to have been influenced by a proposal from an environmental group the ” it was a major success but  is not resting on its laurels our experts will be advising the epa on ways to structure the details of the new standards we aim to get 20 to 30 states to announce their support of epa carbon standards for power plants we will work with those states to show how using state based carbon limits or energy effiency and renewable energy standards will put the epa standards in reach and we will continue mobilizing support for carbon standards with soal media and onthe ground events in all 50 states when the epa releases draft standards for existing power plants we aim to beat our record of generating 3 million comments this time in favor of standards for new power plants nuclear southern california edison deded to permanently retire the two nuclear reactors at its san onofre generating station located on the pafic coast midway between los angeles and san diego thanks to an amicus brief filed by  and fellow

acres of wilderness quality lands in colorado utah and wyoming and in july  released a report showing that tar sands oil carried by the keystone xl pipeline would emit 243 million metric tons more carbon per year than conventional crude proving that the project fails the president’s climate test and is not in the nation’s best interests
