 on april 20 2010 an environmental disaster erupted in the gulf of mexico with devastating implications for north america’s richest marine ecosytem the explosion on the deepwater horizon rig which eventually released an estimated five million barrels of crude oil into gulf waters occurred only weeks before the sea turtle nesting season and just prior to the seasonal migrations of more than one billion birds drawing on more than two decades of experience in the gulf the foundation immediately engaged its longstanding network of conservation partners operating in the region  convened its own experts representatives from federal and state agenes and leading biologists assembling a portfolio of projects to protect imperiled wildlife the strategy targeted spees most at risk — sea turtles shore birds water birds and migratory waterfowl — and stressed immediate action to reduce losses as the damaged well continued to leak and discussions on how to address the catastrophe continued bp announced a plan to donate net revenues from oil recovered from the site to help protect wildlife populations it chose  to administer the fund the foundation quickly launched the priority projects it had identified using an initial commitment of 10 million from bp and an additional 225 million from corporate partner walmart sea turtles in the gulf already endangered were an early focus projects that addressed ongoing threats to their populations including nest disturbances by predators beach erosion and light pollution were quickly accelerated by the sea turtle conservancy a  partner since 2001 the conservancy also allocated funds to help supply and expand 12 permitted turtle rehabilitation services across florida — funding that effectively doubled the capaty for treating sick or injured sea turtles statewide “absolutely everything we did was new and not possible before” said david godfrey the conservancy’s executive director “we needed to improve survivorship and reduce turtle mortality on florida beaches where 90 percent of all sea turtle nesting in the us takes place and our actions will have a multiplier effect this year’s hatchlings are going to grow up come back to nest and gradually grow the population” on the shores of alabama and northwestern florida federal and state offials confronted an unprecedented challenge sea turtle hatchlings emerging from newlylaid eggs faced certain danger from oil contamination in the gulf federal offials contacted  who called on corporate partner fedex for inkind assistance in shipping the eggs to the atlantic coast of florida over the next five weeks fedex’s custom critical service safely delivered more than 25000 turtle eggs the contents of 278 nests to cape canaveral where they were incubated and successfully released elsewhere along the gulf and atlantic coasts  invested in projects to prevent the acdental capture of sea turtles by commeral fisheries — the leading cause of death for turtles and one preventable through improvements to fishing gear as the crisis moved into its third month  and its partners began an initiative to establish alternative habitats for birds migrating towards the spill zone their aim was to provide 100000 acres — a goal that was surpassed fivefold with projects that extended across eight states by the end of august the department of agriculture’s natural resources conservation service nrcs the us fish and wildlife service state agenes and private organizations like ducks unlimited and mississippi wildlife were enrolling gulfarea farmers and landowners in programs that used cropland or restored degraded wetlands to provide habitat and food sources for migrating birds national   louisiana wildlife and fisheries foundation texas rice alabama wildlife federation and others joined the effort farmer glenray trahan who raises rice and cattle in southwestern louisiana flooded close to 2000 acres with spectacular results “we were in the middle of a drought down here and the marshes were dry we knocked the stubble down and started flooding on the 25th of august and we had more bluewinged teal than i had seen in 65 years” he recalls “and when the big duck season started we had more pintails and greenwinged teals than i’d ever seen we couldn’t have done it without the funds we got from  grantee ducks unlimited and nrcs” he adds investments by walmart filled a crual gap by establishing wetland habitat areas on federal and state wildlife refuges — public lands that provide the highest value for bird life around the gulf all told through november 2010 the first phase of projects established nearly 200000 acres of alternative habitat for birds and served as the catalyst for federal agenes to enhance and flood additional lands creating a total of more than 500000 acres ’s gulf response continues at the end of 2010 the foundation began a second phase of funding that will invest an additional 10 million for projects to bolster wildlife and habitat most affected by the spill the benefits for gulf spees will endure long after initial damage from the largest oil spill in us history has passed
