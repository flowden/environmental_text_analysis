 we are pleased to report some important achievements in 2016 in june our years of bipartisan advocacy paid off when congress passed legislation to help protect americans from toxic chemicals in consumer products it is the most significant national environmental law in decades a heartening achievement in these partisan times in october 195 countries agreed to limit carbon emissions from global aviation using a marketbased method that  helped develop shortly afterward the paris climate agreement came into force years earlier than expected the us election raises real concerns about the future of climate action  and our allies are determined to ensure the continued strength of the paris accord and to defend against threats to other vital environmental protections meanwhile the tide is starting to turn for the world’s oceans threequarters of global fisheries could be healthy within ten years our recent study shows if the sustainable management that  is helping to put in place continues to take hold around the world we’re also seeing increased engagement on the part of farmers and other landowners to protect ecosystems for example in our program with walmart and its grocery suppliers companies have committed to cut fertilizer pollution on 23 million acres solving global challenges means expanding our global footprint this year we celebrated the launch of  europe which is already helping to drive progress on clean energy and fisheries reform these advances would not have been possible without your support thank you while there are momentous challenges ahead we are confident that together we can meet them
