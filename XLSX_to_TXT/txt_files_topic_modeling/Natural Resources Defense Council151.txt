 description of key impacts risks and opportunities in 2012  worked to drive major advances in the quality of our air water and climate and touch aspects of our lives ranging from a day at the beach to how we wash our clothes drive our cars and enjoy a baseball game ’s key wins for 2012 included n 545 mpg the obama administration tightened greenhouse gas emission standards to 545 mpg in 2012 the culmination of a bill sponsored by  in california in 2002 and eventually adopted by 13 other states the new standards will eliminate 6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution n the demand of 3 million americans carbon limits on new power plants in the second half of the year the environmental protection agency received a record number of comments from ordinary tizens in support of a proposal that  helped design to set the first national limits on carbon pollution from new power plants when polluters attempted to block the epa from limiting carbon pollution  prevailed with a unanimous desion in a federal appeals court in washington that upheld epa’s determination—based upon a mountain of sentific evidence—that heat trapping pollutants threaten our health and planet n mercury standards with teeth after decades of legal action from  the epa will at last fulfill its obligation to enforce the clean air act and protect america’s air and water from mercury emitted from power plants mercury is a toxin that enters the food supply in fish we eat and can eventually lead to negative health effects n the beginning of the end for antibiotic misuse after more than 35 years of inaction on the health threats posed by antibiotic misuse in animal feed an  lawsuit sparked a federal court to order the us food and drug administration to act on the widespread overuse of all medically important antibiotics this paves the way for an end to the livestock industry’s abuse of these important medines and its whiplash effect—the spread of antibioticresistant disease n greening professional and collegiate sports the professional and collegiate sports industry in a cultural shift of historic proportions is using its influence to advance ecological stewardship thanks to technical expertise from  north america’s sports leagues teams and venues are shifting to more effient and ecologically intelligent operations in doing so they are collectively avoiding millions of pounds of carbon emissions saving millions of gallons of water shifting millions of pounds of paper products toward recycled content and saving millions of dollars mounting pressure for proper storage of nuclear waste in a unanimous desion a federal appeals court ruled that the nuclear regulatory commission failed to adequately address storage needs for spent nuclear fuel a suit brought by  states including new york and other environmental organizations contended that the industry’s storage plan was shortsighted and risky ending overfishing in 2012 the united states became the first country in the world to set catch limits to end overfishing of us ocean fisheries a result that  has fought for relentlessly thanks to this and the legal requirement to restore depleted fish populations which  has vigorously defended for more than a decade most us ocean fish populations are making a comeback elevating effiency of washers and dishwashers following a joint agreement reached by manufacturers  and other consumer and environmental advocates the department of energy issued new standards that will require clothes washers and dishwashers to use less water and energy over the next two decades these energy savings together with other savings created by new appliance standards issued since 2009 will cumulatively save the united states a huge amount of energy—the equivalent of 30 of total us energy used in a single year major challenges lie ahead and  is prioritizing five policy objectives that are winnable and can make the most impact these areas represent some of the most pressing risks to the environment as well as opportunities for  to make dramatic impacts climate action ’s recent win—moving the epa to propose fuel neutral carbon standards for new power plants—has set the stage for national standards on existing plants building upon years of work to secure and defend the legal authority of the clean air act  is now advocating for the epa to establish systemwide carbon intensity targets for each state crediting incremental investment in measures like effiency and renewables  sustainability as an ethical imperative 6 the next phase in battles against antibiotic misuse antibiotic overuse in farming is leading to antibiotic resistant superbugs thus stunting the efficacy of drugs that revolutionized medine and are gravely important to public health in the coming year  will continue working to end non therapeutic uses of penillins and tretracyclines in animal agriculture by 2017 and continue driving market pressure for large producers and grocery store private labels to transition their poultry away from unsafe antibiotic use n fracking community defense ’s community fracking defense project assists communities in defending their land from dangerous fracking impacts and amplifies community action to the state level we are helping to establish statewide grassroots movements by falitating statewide partnerships finanally supporting local leaders through minigrants and providing a relationship management system to track and better connect networks of activists from among those activists we cultivate strong spokespeople to tell stories illustrating the full impact of fracking in local and national media n clean water protections ’s clean water defense team will strengthen support for the clean water act through creation of a strong senate clean water voting bloc while at the same time pursuing two obama administration actions protecting headwater streams and wetlands and controlling urban and suburban runoff pollution  is also bringing the issue of clean water quite literally to the table in pint form through organizing a constituency of craft breweries advocating for clean water protection n moving beyond oil  will continue working to protect our lands and oceans from the impacts of oil drilling in the coming year we will continue building upon the massive mobilization sparked by the keystone xl tar sands pipeline and go after the dollars that prop up big oil with the help of  activists we will compel the senate to eliminate oil subsidies—a highcost and foolhardy investment in a time of national budgetary problems and climate realities that make oil our nation’s worst bet for the future
