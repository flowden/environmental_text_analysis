 walk along any river bank or ocean beach and it’s almost inevitable— you will find a plastic bag blowing in the wind an empty soda bottle right at water’s edge or a foam cup or plastic fork from someone’s picnic buried in the sand we all see it—plastic debris fouling the ocean vistas we so enjoy plastic debris devastates waters all over the world—causing injury and death to turtles seals seabirds and other wildlife contaminating fish damaging marine habitats and quite possibly affecting human health it is high time to reverse this tide and  is doing just that ocean trash far from a new issue for   has “talked trash” for years each fall since 1986 we’ve led the world’s largest marine debris recovery efforts through our international coastal cleanups millions of volunteers have removed tons of trash from waterways and coastlines in more than 150 countries and throughout the united states and its territories but we’ve long known trash removal does not solve the ocean pollution problem and for a number of years we’ve conferred with experts engaged renowned sentists and appealed to industry to help us develop a solution four years ago  commissioned a group of leading sentists with the national center for ecological analysis and synthesis nceas at the university of california santa barbara their sentific mandate was to examine the best available data from around the world about plastics in the ocean and quantify how much there is where it comes from what happens to it and how it impacts fish and wildlife the sentists’ findings will be published in peerreviewed sentific literature in 2015 over the past year  also conducted its own research on the supply chain of plastics our goal was to craft a solution that will keep plastics from getting into the ocean in the first place the situation is far from hopeless there are many ways to stem the tide of plastics into the ocean all have value and they work • bans on plastic bags countries like bangladesh and ties like portland ore and mexico ty have passed laws banning them and the first statewide ban recently passed in california • innovative redesign of products and packaging using alternative materials and pressuring manufacturers to rethink their plastic footprints are increasing • consumer awareness publicfang campaigns urge consumers to shed “disposable mentalities” reduce consumption and reuse containers like water bottles mugs and grocery bags and we need other solutions as well while these efforts as well as recycling products that can be used again definitely help we need an intervention global in scope to dramatically reduce the flow of plastics into the ocean consider the facts • ocean plastics are greatest in rapidly developing countries where waste collection is weak or absent • without intervention within 25 years the ocean will contain approximately one pound of plastic for every three pounds of fish • only a small percentage of ocean plastics rest at the surface of the “gyres” • evidence suggests that over time the plastic breaks into tiny pieces often eaten by marine mammals and fish that mistake them for food • research confirms that plastics are present in more than 200 spees of fish this could have implications for animals that ingest them and for people too so what is  doing about plastic pollution global plastics consumption is predicted to explode to an estimated 400 million tons per year by 2025 this consumption will largely take place in rapidly industrializing countries which also have some of the lowest waste collection rates on the planet without effective waste collection an avalanche of plastic debris will enter the ocean if we focus our efforts on managing waste in those places where plastic pollution is greatest we can reduce ocean plastic inputs while plastic products have done much for the world—think medical equipment industrial machinery automobiles construction—plastics producers and consumer products companies have to take responsibility for what plastics are doing to the ocean  has developed a plan— and industries are getting on board through our trash free seas alliance® we have signed up several global companies that agree we’re on the right track and have pledged to work with us with industry economists waste experts and other ngos we are developing a funding mechanism to establish sound waste management in countries that need it once implemented these systems create the conditions that make it possible for local communities to profitably gather separate sell and store plastic waste thus reversing the tide of plastics entering the ocean—while advanng the health economies and wellbeing of the communities served we are convinced we are on to something big bold and ambitious that can truly make a difference and help rid the ocean of plastic we will keep you informed as this exting project develops and we hope we can count on your support as we go forward in 2015 and beyond to stem the tide of plastics in our ocean
