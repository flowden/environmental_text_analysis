 the challenge since the late 1980s unesco and individual countries in latin america and the caribbean have attempted to preserve important areas of biodiver sity by designating them protected places or “parks” however because many coun tries lack funds for longterm preservation most of these places have had little or no protection and are parks in name only dubbed “paper parks” by conservationists in addition areas set aside as protected often are inhabited by people who rely on the forest and its animals for their livelihood intrinsically connected to the communities that surround them these places require experienced management that is sensitive to both human and ecological needs how we’re making a difference twelve years ago with support from the us agency for international development usaid the conservancy founded the parks in peril program dedicated to protecting the region’s biodiversity by saving its imperiled “paper parks” the program pursues four goals first parks in peril works to establish onsite protection for highbiodiversity areas it then aims to integrate protected areas into the economic and cultural life of the communities that surround them educating local people about dangers to biodiversity and developing alternative livelihoods consistent with conservation the program also works to create longterm funding mechanisms that sustain local management of protected places finally areas protected by the program become living laboratories in which sentists can study the destructive forces that threaten biodiversity their new knowledge can then influence change on a larger scale today parks in peril is one of usaid’s most successful programs and provides finanal support and sentific expertise to protect and manage more than 28 million acres of national park and other reserves in 37 sites across 15 countries in latin america and the caribbean these areas are now protected from uncontrolled tourism unsustainable forestry and conversion to agricultural land and are managed by trained park guards—often recruited from local communities—preventing poaching working with local inhabitants monitoring threatened spees and ensuring compliance with local regulations in 2001 the conservancy and usaid launched a 30 million initiative to renew parks in peril and expand it to eight additional protected areas covering 40 million acres with this funding the program which gained new visibility at the 2003 world parks congress will also be able to train managers of hundreds of additional natural sites and to expand its network of partner organizations greatly improving the odds for enduring protection of natural areas in the region
