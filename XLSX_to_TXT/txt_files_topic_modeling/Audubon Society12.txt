 friends 1 margery nicolson pafic palisades california the sandhill cranes are what hooked margery nicolson more than two decades ago she and her late husband iain traveled to nebraska’s platte river for the birds’ annual migration “we were just enchanted” she says “it’s a spectacle you won’t see anywhere else in the world” since then margery has returned to nebraska’s rowe sanctuary annually first to help develop and fund what was to become the iain nicolson audubon center then to act as a bird guide and eventually a board member she is also currently in her fourth term on the board of audubon alaska where she works on such environmental challenges as logging in the tongass national forest and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge previously she spent six years each on the board of national audubon and audubon california margery loves untamed nature it’s her desire to save these places—and the birds and wildlife that inhabit them—as well as her interest in audubon’s new focus on individual flyways that spur her continued work with our organization 2 farming for the birds with almost half of its 100 million acres in either crops or grazing california ranks first among us states in agricultural production that production however has come at a high cost for wildlife the loss of 95 percent of the wetlands that migrat ing waterfowl shorebirds and other spees depend on in the central valley many birds now turn to rice farms as alternative habitat these lands now represent more than 80 percent of available wetlands in winter that’s why audubon california is partnering with individual rice growers and other stakeholders including the natural resources conservation service  prbo conservation sence and the california rice commission to ensure that these flooded rice fields are managed in ways that also support bird populations to date nearly 200 california rice growers have signed up for this innovative central valley program for such audubon priority spees as blacknecked stilts western sandpipers long billed curlews and sandhill cranes the benefit is healthy welcoming winter and stopover habitat international chile protecting working lands the remote chiloé archipelago located off the central coast of chile encompasses astonishing marine and coastal biodiversity the island chain’s coastal wetlands play a critical role in the lifecycle of many birds serving as winter home to virtually all hudsonian godwits in the pafic flyway as well as to 61 percent of all pafic breeding whimbrels audubon is working with our chilean conservation partner cecpan el centro de estudios y conservaón del patrimonio natural to engage private landowners to implement land management practices that protect shorebirds improve water quality and balance agriculture with conservation chapters 4 offshore conservation seabirds are among our most vulnerable birds and face many challenges including overfishing which depletes available food introduced invasive spees and other impacts to breeding islands human recreation which can disturb nesting habitat and coastal development which destroys some wetlands and compromises the quality of others these threats converge with feroty in california with potentially grim consequences for such audubon priority spees as the ashy stormpetrel the pafic brant the marbled godwit the black oystercatcher and the marbled murrelet ensuring healthy habitat calls for protecting their ocean feeding grounds as well as coastal and island habitat the mendono  and audubon california led efforts to establish marine reserves on california’s north coast that included protections for seabirds and shorebirds at global ibas and other sites the california fish and game commission’s approval this year of sweeping new protections for marine areas from the oregon border to point arena was a testimony to their efforts and a tremendous victory for marine birds centers 5 nurturing tomorrow’s leaders for more than 10 years the audubon center at debs park has introduced families and children in its east los angeles community to the rich natural world in their own backyard but providing inspiring encounters with nature is only the first step in developing the next generation of conservation leaders internship opportunities that offer training in both environmental education and the world of work help take partipants to the next level this year the center at debs park expanded its already successful internship program drawing applicants from throughout los angeles and significantly increasing the program’s diversity during their eightweek internships high school and college students learned the basics of conservation and environmental education and helped develop and deliver the center’s summer camp program to 170 children—inspiring them in turn to learn about nature friends 7 susan packard orr palo alto california you could say it’s written in her dna a love of nature and a passion for protecting the environment are no doubt attributes that susan packard orr inherited from her father “he was a great outdoorsman he loved the land” she says “the packard foundation has worked in conservation since the beginning” whether she’s breathing in the scene of thousands of sandhill cranes streaming into a marsh at dusk savoring the call of loons on the arctic tundra or watching a rosebreasted grosbeak swaying on a wire she marvels endlessly at the beauty of birds— and the challenges they face protecting the flyways is key she says of audubon’s focus “so many of the birds we enjoy in our gardens and parks are not with us all the time and if we want to continue to have them we need to pay attention to their full lifecycle and the full extent of their habitat” she is reminded of this constantly “sometimes when i see a bird on my travels i wonder ‘have you been to my place’ ” 6 building pafic northwest communities just five miles from downtown seattle in one of the nation’s most diverse communities the seward park audubon center sits on a 277acre peninsula extending into lake washington sculpted by glaers the surrounding landscape encompasses a range of habitats including a stand of oldgrowth forest as well as savannas grasslands and lakeshore and is home to many spe es including bald eagles to appeal to a surrounding community as diverse and varied as seward park’s center staff offer a wide array of volunteer oppor tunities sencebased educational programs and family activities all designed to promote both enjoyment and appreation of the pafic north west’s rich natural heritage one of the center’s most successful programs is the alwayspopular owl prowl party  walk which includes a night hike into the forest to learn about the park’s owls and their forest habitats within the urban ecosystem with 16000 visitors each year the center is a vital and growing resource for learning and conservation
