 every us region struggles with environmental hot spots where people often minorities suffer from pollution but now states and ties are taking advantage of advanced technology to identify and stop air pollution at the neighborhood level for decades ties tracking air pollution have relied on a handful of monitors mounted on towers or rooftops but these can’t pinpoint the areas often in lowincome communities where people are exposed to more pollution now ties and states are starting to take advantage of new technology to identify pollution hot spots and develop polies that will reduce pollution at the neighborhood level for example california passed a law requiring air pollution reduction plans for some of the state’s most contaminated neighborhoods where houses and schools are squeezed in between oil refineries industrial falities and truck routes  is working with academic industry and community partners and government offials to collect detailed air pollution data in such neighborhoods providing pollution insights literally block by block working with google earth outreach and others  has deployed google street view cars outfitted with fastresponse air pollution sensors to develop maps of local air pollution in the san fransco bay area houston and london in oakland california we partnered with health care provider kaiser permanente which combined electronic health records with the pollution data we obtained with aclima sensors to determine the effect of air pollution on people in the community the analysis published in the journal environmental health found that streets with more pollution correlated with increased heart disease among the elderly even small increases in smog pollutants were assoated with a 16 percent increased risk of heart disease the same was true of black carbon a type of soot coming largely from trucks “local action requires local information” says  health sentist dr ananya roy a coauthor of the study “ is making local pollution not only visible but actionable” now  is working to encourage the use of blockbyblock air quality mapping in communities globally our newest project in london will take readings in tens of thousands of locations tywide to inform polies to reduce air pollution c40 ties a partner in the initiative will share the results with its 96 member ties with the aim of improving air quality for hundreds of millions of people in ties around the world
