 many people blame los angeles’s notoriously clogged freeways for its smog problem what should they know about the role of its ports melissa lin perrella in the 1980s los angeles was known for the thick haze that just hung over the ty today it still ranks as the most ozonepolluted metro area in the country but it’s significantly cleaner than it once was cars contribute of course but the ports are actually the largest contributor to la’s smog problem to give you a sense of their size the los angeles and long beach ports which are neighbors make up the san pedro bay complex—the ninthbusiest container port complex in the world it handled almost a third of the country’s containerized trade in 2017 when we talk about the traffic at the port we aren’t just referring to the ships which emit diesel exhaust but also to the trucks and trains and equipment that transport all the goods how has your work made a dent in la’s air pollution it started back in the 1990s when the port of los angeles proposed expanding its china shipping terminal we already knew the health impacts from diesel exhaust—the elevated risks of heart disease of asthma of cancer residents were concerned and came to us for help so with a coalition  challenged the expansion we proved that the port violated the california environmental quality act by not disclosing how the project would impact health and by not doing anything to minimize that impact the settlement that came out of that fight included a much cleaner version of the original project environmentalists and the surrounding communities took on one of california’s largest economic engines—and won it was a wakeup call for the ports that they could no longer do business as usual after our lawsuit the ports began adopting—for the first time— clean air polies and health goals that work continues today who are your main allies in this fight it’s not just environmentalists that are paying attention to port pollution it’s really the frontline communities the ones affected about 900000 people live in the area surrounding the ports called the los angeles harbor region almost two thirds are people of color they’re deeply invested in this fight because even with the progress we’ve made they still have higher cancer rates from diesel pollution than residents else where and industry is still pushing for new polluting port projects right by schools and homes even though cleaner alternatives exist  would not have seen as much suc cess as it has over the past 20 years had it not been for these residents who know the ports are putting their families at risk and have let every politian hear about it we’re also working within coalitions the moving for ward network has been instrumental it’s a national coalition that works to reduce the public health impacts of our freight transportation system  is a proud member we’re working alongside community organizations universities faithbased groups and other advocates the only way we’ll get there is if everyone feels invested and everyone brings what they can to the table what’s your next goal recently  and its coalition partners persuaded the mayors of los angeles and long beach to sign a joint executive directive that set the goal of 100 percent zeroemissions trucks serving the ports by 2035 and all zeroemissions cargo handling equipment by 2030 keep in mind there are about 13000 trucks that make multiple trips to the ports every day we are now working to ensure the ports take the necessary actions to make these goals a reality while this is a local story about cleaning up two ports could it offer lessons for others fang similar issues yes innovative technologies and polies are being adopted in los angeles and long beach and ports around the world are watching we’re changing the industry community members and government offials regularly reach out to  for advice with that said we still have a lot of work to do we are constantly holding the ports’ feet to the fire our work won’t be done until we have clean air to breathe
