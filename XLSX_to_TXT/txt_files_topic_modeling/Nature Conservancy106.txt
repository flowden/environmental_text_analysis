 global demand for food energy and shelter are putting unprecedented pressure on our planet and freshwater is at the heart of this crisis as the human population has increased dramatically over the past 40 years we have lost more than threequarters of the population of fish amphibians birds and mammals that depend on freshwater ecosystems around the world the world may need to invest more than a trillion dollars a year just to build our way out of our water scarty problem additional infrastructure for hydropower and flood control if not done well could irreversibly compromise the very rivers lakes and natural habitats  has spent decades protecting we must find a more balanced approach that combines both natural and traditional built solutions to do so the conservancy is working with land managers water utilities hydropower operators ties and corporations our goal is to fundamentally change the way the world uses and manages our most preous resource—water—to the benefit of both people and nature we are continuing to protect the planet’s great rivers by working with governments and communities to keep wild stretches free flowing and healthy and to restore rivers that have been damaged in the past we are transforming how soety values and uses water resources to be more sustainable—engaging the hydropower industry for example to site future dams where they will minimize negative impacts on aquatic life and on people’s livelihoods and cultural values and we are inspiring individuals and institutions to integrate a water conservation ethic into our way of life employing innovative strategies such as water funds to enable ties to support the conservation and restoration of forests and grasslands in watersheds that hold and filter the water on which people depend china’s yangtze river offers just one example of our integrated efforts here we are employing strategies we have pioneered in the americas along with innovations we are developing with chinese partners in a nation undergoing unprecedented development and growth we seek to demonstrate a better future for china’s most important river and the life that depends on it the application of these strategies around the world is how we are expanding the scope and scale of conservation to generate benefits both now and for future generations
