 ’s mission is to stop and eventually reverse the degradation of the planet’s natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature over its 40year history  has grown into one of the world’s largest and most effective independent organizations dedicated to the conservation of nature it has reached this status through a constant record of conservation achievements today  operates in nearly 100 countries supported by some five million people worldwide its initials and famous panda logo have become a powerful rallying point for those who care about the future of the planet and want to help shape it in a positive way the organization’s success and reputation have been built around a factual sencebased approach to conservation which focuses on six priority issues forests fresh water oceans and coasts threatened spees and the insidious threats of toxic chemicals and climate change to underpin its work  runs highly focused programmes based on these issues of global concern each programme has identified conservation targets summarized in the following pages for the next ten years to help with the delivery of these targets short highprofile campaigns wherever possible involving the general public are initiated  runs some 1200 projects around the world in any year many of ’s 3800 staff work at the front line of conservation sometimes in difficult and dangerous conditions helping to make maximum use of the approximately us273 million that  spends annually on its global conservation work ontheground projects are reinforced with policy work and campaigns as well as education and local capaty building to help replicate conservation successes saving the world’s speal places recognizing that local conservation problems often have their roots in wider soal and economic issues which influence how people use and consume resources and affect the environment  has adopted an approach which links field and advocacy work to address environmental problems within areas whose boundaries are defined by nature – what  terms “ecoregions” these may be tropical forests or large areas of freshwater wetlands spanning one or more countries or entire coral reef systems such as australia’s great barrier reef  has identified some 200 such places – the “global 200 ecoregions” – which harbour most of the world’s remaining biological diversity and which must be preserved if we are to leave a living planet for future generations the organization has selected 77 of these areas to focus on and is working with partner organizations to develop action plans ambitious broadscale and integrated in nature these plans combine environmental economic and soal actions to conserve or restore the biodiversity of an entire ecoregion gifts to the earth “gifts to the earth” the highly successful conservation tool developed by  in 1996 continues to win commitments from governments industry and individuals to preserve the most significant parts of our natural heritage by mid2001 66 gifts had been recognized by  among them were new legislation in mauritania to protect the banc d’arguin – an area of shallow coastal waters and tidal mudflats of international importance for migratory waterbirds – and the commitment by turkey to increase the size of its protected areas by 50 per cent communicating the message over the past year ’s awardwinning website – wwwpandaorg – has been further developed into an immensely powerful tool for awarenessraising and action thousands of people are now using “panda passport” to register their concerns about conservation issues of the moment by harnessing the views of so many people  is able to bring pressure to bear on policy and desionmakers to make a real difference 4 campaigning for conservation the  network since its foundation as a charity under swiss law in 1961 ’s network of offices has grown steadily to cover most regions of the world at the heart of the network is the international secretariat based in gland switzerland it identifies and monitors emerging conservation concerns guides the development of ’s position on international issues coordinates campaign communications and fundraising activities manages the international conservation pro gramme and policy work and builds global partnerships the  network contributes expertise and funding to ’s international conservation programme activities range from practical field projects and sentific research to advising on environmental policy promoting environmental education and raising public understanding of environmental issues two spealist offices in brussels and washington work to influence the polies and activities of the european union and institutions which deal with global economic issues such as the world bank and the global environment fality gef in 2001 the number of  offices grew with the admission to the network of turkey which previously had been one of five assoates – independent nongovernmental organizations ngos which work closely with  towards shared conservation objectives
