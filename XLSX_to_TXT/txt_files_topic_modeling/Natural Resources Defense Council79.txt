 these days we can’t count on federal agenes charged with ensuring a healthy environment and public health to carry out their duties how has your strategy shifted to reflect this new landscape sujatha jahagirdar given the gridlock we have seen in congress and the regulatory stalemates we’re working within the market because so many industries have be come so consolidated there’s an opportunity to make big changes quickly in the food service industry three companies own 75 percent of the market share that means if you get three companies to commit to a change you’ve trans formed the entire sector for example  is working with compass—the largest food service company in the country—to help reduce its impact on global warming by pushing it to buy 30 per cent less red meat and more vegetables over the course of three years livestock espeally grazers like cows and sheep are incredibly resourceintensive to produce and in the united states beef is responsible for more emissions than almost all other foods combined  staff have also helped build the market for “imperfect” fruits and vegetables healthy foods that otherwise have gone to waste given their off size or shape that includes catalyzing development of compass’s imperfectly delious produce program which is now rescuing produce from farms across the nation in another partnership  works with the food services and falities management company sodexo in piloting and evaluating the use of wastetracking software a tool we’re currently testing through our food waste reduction initiative in nashville how does  help make the case to encourage industries to pursue changes like these a big part of our advocacy work is per suasion insider lobbying for example we conduct and share case studies that offer examples of corporate innovators around the country experimenting with solutions to find new ways to tackle food waste and show companies how they can follow suit we’re also demonstrating how much support there is for these changes which is often very important companies recognize there’s a whole lot of public support for sustainability polies right now that’s largely what’s driving it—consumer preference in the case for climate health that means plantforward menus people want healthier more sustainable options who else are you pushing to be more sustainable right now we’re working to convince aramark which is one of the top three service companies providing food to places like college campuses hospitals and stadiums we’ve sent a letter signed by 70 organizations from the humane soety to oxfam to the  asking aramark to cut its purchases of climateintensive foods it’d be a really big deal cutting their menus’ emissions by 20 percent they’ve launched a pilot program but expanding it nationwide is the next step we’re also working on developing a scorecard to grade food service companies—like the ones that supply cafeterias and college campuses—on how climate friendly their options are we’re trying to falitate a race to the top and publicly recognize those that are succeeding
