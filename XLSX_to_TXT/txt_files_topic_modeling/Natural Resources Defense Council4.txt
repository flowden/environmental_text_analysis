 nearly a century before the novel coronavirus emerged from a wildlife market in wuhan china a novel h1n1 virus swept the globe that virus commonly known as the spanish flu or 1918 influenza infected more than onethird of the worlds human population it is suspected to have originated in the united states most likely from birds indeed more than 60 percent of emerging infectious diseases originate in animals and most of those from wild animals still the world continues to eat use and trade wildlife as well as encroach upon their habitats in ways that make the spread of viruses like covid19 far more likely s nature program is working to help shape domestic policy on wildlife trade as well as advocating through international treaties to end nearly all commeral wildlife trade the bottom line is that wildlife trade is a threat to our public health that only stands to become greater as humans increasingly exploit spees and encroach upon previously untouched habitat says elly pepper nroos deputy director of international wildlife conservation and with many global leaders focusing on how to avoid future outbreaks  is calling on them to move forward with a response commensurate with the threat in china  experts were invited to provide the countrys national forestry and grassland administration with formal recommendations for amending its wildlife protection law which the government deded to review and modify in response to covid19 that law dictates which wild spees are deemed protected and which ones chinese residents can eat own sell wear farm or hunt  also offered the government other policy suggestions on how to reduce the risk of future outbreaks as part of these recommendations beijingbased  policy analyst ning lisa hua and her colleagues proposed that china eliminate a list of more than 100 birds mammals amphibians and insects that can be sold for things like food medine pets or pelts under the law many of the spees on that list are not only potential vectors of disease but also face extinction such as the spoonbilled sandpiper the yellowbreasted bunting and the elongated tortoise the  team recommended these spees instead be categorized as protected under the law for some of the spees their population might still be big now but if commeral use is always allowed or the spees isnt protected under the law as time goes by they may become endangered hua says the  wildlife conservation teams recommendations also included increased interagency management and enforcement coordination at both the national and provinal levels and more public partipation during desionmaking processes the issue of risky wildlife tradeboth legal and illegalextends well beyond chinas borders countries like the united states france and italy remain some of the worlds largest consumers of wildlife as food pets trophies fur and medine to me that means the united states as an obligation says zak smith director of international wildlife conservation at  if we want to avoid the cost of a future pandemic then part of that is clamping down on wildlife trade and being willing to invest in that i can guarantee its going to be cheaper than what we are going through in may  ano the center for biological diversity released an action plan recommending that the federal government immediately ban imports and exports of all live wildlife permanently close domestic livewildlife markets direct increased funds to the us fish  wildlife service and other us agenes and strengthen the convention on international trade in endangered spees tes to prevent future zoonotic pandemics the message has resonated with some members of congress including senators john cornyn and cory booker who recently crafted the bipartisan preventing future pandemics act pfpa the bill which would prohibit the import export purchase or sale of live wild animals for food or medine has yet to be heard in committee but advocates are hopeful that it will advance under the new administration considering that the united states imports well over 200000 live mammals and birds every yearand is one of the worlds top importers of live wildlifethe pfpa is an important start pepper says with the risk of future zoonotic pandemics increasing and sentists predicting that one million spees stand to go extinct its critical we pass legislation to address these threats habitat conservation is another critical defense against the unprecedented levels of human wildlife and wildlife wildlife interactions spreading disease fueled by harmful activities such as clearing intact ecosystems for industrial uses alongside sentists indigenous groups and partner organizations  is campaigning to conserve 30 percent of the worlds lands and oceans by 2030an urgent goal that president biden recognized through a pledge made in january 2021 as part of an array of environmentally focused executive orders the stakes are high thriving ecosystems filled with abundant wildlife are the foundation for human life as we know it lhis natural life support system cleans our air and Â·water supports the pollinators and seafood that put food on our tables and sequesters the carbon thats driving climate change if theres ever been a time to radically renegotiate our relationship to the natural world it is now
