 the origin of the word “philanthropy” dates to the early 17th century and literally means “love of mankind” modern definitions refer to “an altruistic concern for human welfare” or “a gift made for human itarian purposes” astonishingly the core meaning of philanthropy excludes reference to our natural world ’s mission—to conserve the lands and waters upon which all life depends— aggressively enhances the fundamental meaning of philanthropy beyond its original frame we recognize and embrace the heartfelt belief that the welfare of mankind is inextricably intertwined with the health of our planet to love mankind is without doubt to love nature throughout ’s history we have relied upon this enhanced version of philanthropy to achieve our mission generations of donors have generously and enthusiastically supported projects strategies sence and all manner of organizational investments indeed this year we raised a record 791 million from thousands of supporters—from 25 members up to the largest single gift of private philanthropy in our history—165 million from jack and laura dangermond to acquire a magnificent stretch of the california coast see page 6 we deeply value each and every act of generosity it is your loyal commitment your philanthropy that propels  as a membership organization we continuously enhance how people choose to support their love of nature and humanity staying abreast of generational changes in giving for millennials it’s not their grandparents’ ways of giving our membership program is aggressively testing donation methods from live face toface solitation to strategic partipatory digital engagement ensuring that the culture of philanthropy that sustains us adapts to changing technology and personal preferences in just four years online giving for instance has doubled and now represents 22 percent of our overall membership revenue beyond individual philanthropy we are expanding engagement with the corporate sector we were a pioneer back in 1973 when we negotiated a corporate gift of 49000 acres that became the core of the great dismal swamp national wildlife refuge that action opened the door for environmental ngos to seek support from the business world today we partner with companies around the world to both influence their practices and encourage direct finanal support for innovative strategies like tackling climate change and providing food sustainably once again philanthropy enhanced as an example we have helped bring together global companies like cargill and bunge to reduce the negative effects of agriculture in brazil’s amazon and cerrado as we engage such companies’ philanthropic arms to support ngos that are finding and testing innovative strategies in the coming years we will expand our corporate collaboration dramatically we can’t just point the finger at business for its impact on the natural world we need to fully engage corporations—and their finanal resources— in developing solutions perhaps the most revolutionary enhancement we’ve recently added to our philanthropic capabilities is around impact investing impact investing in our case allows donors to complement their direct giving by investing capital in innovative conservation deals in 2014  established a groundbreaking new program naturevest that structures investment opportunities to support conservation investors seek a return on their investment which for many allows them to then reinvest that capital in other such opportunities such moneyback philanthropy opens the door to a wide range of new capital sources aimed at investing in nature in this report two such projects developed in collaboration with the naturevest team are the groundbreaking debtforconservation conversion in the seychelles see page 47 and the stormwater abate ment model established in the district of columbia see page 35 in fiscal year 2018 the  board approved six transactions representing a potential 16 billion in investment capital that can demonstrate a new way to finance land and ocean protection a sustainable food and water supply and efforts to build healthy ties and tackle climate change no doubt the future will see even more creative ways to steadily enhance philanthropic support for conservation the growing scope and scale of our work demand it generous donors are using all sorts of resources including stock real estate art and antiquities business interests and even livestock and commodities like soybeans to fund gifts for con servation meanwhile our triedandtrue approaches con tinue to generate excellent results last year we celebrated the 25th anniversary of our legacy club—those dedicated  supporters who have chosen to extend their giving beyond their lives by remembering us in their wills and estate plans we are eternally grateful for these bequests that alone represented 17 percent of our donated income last year your legacy lives on all philanthropy is deeply personal anchored in one’s values and beliefs the act of giving is fundamentally a manifestation of who we are and what we care most about as supporters of  we share beliefs about the profound importance of the environment we feel a sense of urgency a need to be bold and aggressive to steadily innovate and reimagine conservation now is the time to stand up not to stand by—because the welfare of humanity absolutely cannot be separated from the welfare of our planet it is all one and we are all in it together thank you
