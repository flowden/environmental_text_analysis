 we’ve learned that protecting earth’s last great places takes both heart and sound sence in the past five decades the conservancy has grown and evolved into an enterprise recognized around the world for sophisticated sencebased strategies using conservation by design—a planning methodology we’ve refined over the past 10 years—we assess the ecological value and priorities of each location we seek to protect we also determine which tools—from conservation easements and largescale ecological assessments to debt fornature swaps and communitybased restoration projects—suit a project’s needs we’ve learned that lasting results require dedicated and diverse partners and funding sources wherever we work we engage others in our mission— government and nongovern ment organizations businesses and nonprofits conservation groups and tizens sentists and farmers ranchers and fishermen from the banks of the upper mississippi to the solomon islands—wherever people depend on ecologically important land for their livelihoods—we collaborate with local communities to protect their rights while we preserve critical habitat and in addition to soliting private donations we seek public funding for our largescale efforts we’ve also learned that conservation achievements can and must be measured—but not just in dollars and acres today we rely on a broad array of measures that tell us how well our methods are working where we can improve and what we can adapt to other locations we assess these measures on every project and across the broad ecologically defined areas we seek to protect with four other conservation organizations—  wildlife conservation soety and the african wildlife foundation—we’re working to establish a conservation audit process that can be used to assess the effectiveness of all conservation projects the shared standards and processes that emerge from this partnership will guide all our work in the future everything the conservancy has learned about conservation that works confirms our belief that the right tools in the hands of the right people lead to lasting results in the pages that follow we present some of the projects that illustrate our philosophy our methods and our progress in 2004 and some of the people—inspired skilled dedicated—who make conservation work
