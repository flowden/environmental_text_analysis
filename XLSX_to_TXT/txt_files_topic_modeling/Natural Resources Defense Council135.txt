 in the weeks before hosting the asia pafic economic cooperation summit in november 2014 beijing went to great lengths to clean up its notoriously dirty air offials ordered factories and schools closed shut down construction sites across the ty and issued a partial ban on driving—all in a desperate attempt to reduce air pollution by 40 percent before the arrival of leaders from more than 20 countries including the united states that plan didn’t work as hoped but something even better emerged from the meeting in a major shift away from shortterm quickfix solutions china committed to a bold longterm plan to curb its dangerous pollution problem on november 12 president xi jinping in a joint agreement with president obama pledged to stop the growth of the country’s carbon pollution by around 2030 that’s huge considering that china accounts for nearly 30 percent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions on the heels of that historic announcement china made another groundbreaking move—one that will prove vital to meeting its 2030 target it released its first national plan to limit coal use the main source of carbon pollution and the nation’s largest contributor to global climate change china which currently uses nearly as much coal as the rest of the world combined pledged to cap its consumption at 42 billion tons by 2020—a direct reflection of the strategy that  has promoted over the past few years as the organization’s work in china has expanded and borne fruit the plan debuted immediately after  and partners convened a major coalcap workshop in beijing the twoday event brought together more than 450 chinese and international partipants and highlighted initial research results on the topic including an  paper finding that coal consumption is responsible for up to 60 percent of the pollution behind china’s crippling smog confronting its coal problem “putting a lid on coal is the singlemost important step china can take to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions” says barbara finamore ’s asia director she adds that an “ambitious yet achievable cap can help peak its emissions even earlier than the 2030 date announced” indeed china’s coal consumption is already dropping last year it decreased for the first time in 14 years and carbon emissions fell for the first time this century—a clear signal that the country is serious about cleaning up its act and refuting critisms that it plans to “do nothing” before 2030 the health of the country and the world stands to benefit greatly from these commitments coal currently provides twothirds of china’s energy and is responsible for more than half of its air pollution that pollution causes more than a million premature deaths in the country every year—which accounts for about 40 percent of airpollution mortality worldwide meanwhile a drastic cut in coal and in carbon emissions more generally significantly improves the chance of keeping global warming below the internationally accepted twodegree celsius guideline helping to stave off the gravest effects of climate change including extreme weather and sealevel rise a focus on clean energy and energy effiency last year’s monumental commitments aren’t all that china is doing to change its ways during his joint announcement with president obama president xi also agreed to generate 20 percent of the country’s electrity from renewable sources by 2030 solar power is already being added at a breakneck pace—after installing 106 solar gigawatts in 2014 china is well on its way toward meeting its goal of installing more than three times that by the end of 2015 effiency is another important element of the overall energy efforts as part of the joint agreement that took place in november presidents xi and obama expanded funding for the uschina clean energy research center of which  is a member to support the development of building effiency and other clean energy technologies ties like shanghai are already blazing the trail as part of an innovative pilot program that  helped develop customers voluntarily reduce electrity use upon request to help alleviate stress on power grids the program has been so successful that it’s now serving as a model for other ties across china cutting pollution at the source china’s coal and carbon targets provide the necessary framework for redung pollution but tackling the problem at its source is also critical seven of the ten busiest shipping ports in the world are in this country yet unlike at other ports emissions here are largely unregulated as david pettit director of ’s southern california air program notes “poor regulation at chinese ports is allowing one container ship to pollute as much as 500000 trucks in a single day” ships passing through most of china’s ports are allowed to use the dirtiest diesel fuel which contains dangerously high levels of sulfur a huge threat to public health guided by successful cleanup efforts at the ports of los angeles and long beach in california where diesel emissions have dropped by 80 percent from a dozen years ago  is helping develop regulations and solutions for tackling the same problem at ports in china’s pearl river delta— an indispensable part of the country’s overall battle against dirty air health problems and ultimately climate change with these commitments china is sending a strong signal to the rest of the planet that it is making changes to reduce carbon pollution— a very different and much brighter picture for negotiators to consider as the world prepares for the next round of global climate talks in paris at the end of 2015
