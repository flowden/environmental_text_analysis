 for healthy forests a little bit of fire can be a great thing trees animals and entire ecosystems have evolved to not only tolerate wildfire but to thrive in the presence of seasonal burns such is the case in the legendary forests of california home of towering redwoods massive sequoias and prolific ponderosa pines left on their own these forests enjoy natural resilience to occasional wildfires often sparked by lightning flames move through burn off dead wood and remove young competitors from mature stands wherever fire burns hot enough to kill oldgrowth trees new meadows and pockets of young forest spring up wildlife flourishes in the resulting patchwork of habitats the modern world has disrupted this system depriving these forests of their natural ability to tolerate wildfires temperatures are climbing droughts are intensifying and wildfires are growing more destructive millions of people have moved into fireprone areas leading to the suppression of wildfires that would have normally moved through and burned off excess fuels invasive insects have demated forests and left mountainsides of standing dead trees waiting to erupt in flame invasive more flammable plants have moved into fire scars displang native vegetation and putting forests and communities at heightened risk of future fires our nation’s great forests along with the wildlife people and headwaters within now face threats at a scale far beyond what any one agency or entity can address that’s why  focuses on launching and managing landscapescale initiatives that bring together public agenes and private companies our funding partners and fastmoving experienced implementers our grantees to generate immediate and sustainable results many of the grants we award through these programs support the tough gritty work being done right now to make our nation’s forested landscapes and the communities within more resilient to wildfire working closely with federal and state foresters we have launched and managed three major competitive grant programs focused on forest health in california we also award wildfirerelated grants in other parts of the nation through several programs focused on community and coastal resilience additional grant programs focus more broadly on fireprone regions including the rocky mountains and the vast forests of the southeast
