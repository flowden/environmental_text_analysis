 in the summer of 2010 as a federal judge in a missoula montana courthouse presided over a hearing on whether wolves in montana and idaho should be granted the same protections as wolves in neighboring wyoming dozens of antiwolf protesters marched outside with handwritten placards “got wolves shoot them” and “save an elk herd kill a wolf” but on august 5 2010 the wolf prevailed us district judge donald molloy sided with  earth justice and 13 other conservation groups and restored endangered spees act protection to wolves across the northern rockies following the obama administration’s desion to strip montana and idaho wolves of federal protection in 2009 more than 500 wolves were gunned down by hunters or government agents as we battled in court to turn back the administration’s reckless desion we mobilized our members and online activists to demand that all 1700 northern rockies wolves be protected until their population can fully recover meanwhile our team of wolf experts led by veteran wildlife advocate louisa willcox in our livingston montana office worked tirelessly to promote  as a credible sencebased voice on every front where the battle over the wolf’s future was playing out— from rancher meetings to regional news outlets to the offices of wildlife agenes thanks to online communication tools including ’s switchboard blog and soal media networks such as twitter our experts from the fields of advocacy law sence and communications were able to respond instantly to developments as they unfolded and build strong support for wolves in a tone that was both authoritative and personal “given our experience in the convoluted and torturous delisting process over the last four years” wrote willcox in a june 2010 blog post “it is clear that the government has no good road map of how to get a recovery plan that  ensures a healthy wolf population in the long term is that too much to ask for a spees that so many of us have spent so much blood sweat and tears to recover” the federal court’s ruling put a halt to more public hunts that were planned for the fall sparing the lives of perhaps hundreds of wolves not surprisingly the ageold battle over the wolf’s fate continues offials are now scrambling for loopholes that if approved by the obama administration would allow them to move forward with the mass killing of wolves and in congress bills have already been introduced that would strip wolves of all endangered spees act protections fortunately  is better positioned than ever to meet such threats head on—both in court and congress we will continue to mobilize our members and reach out to stakeholders on both sides of the debate until we secure a sound recovery plan that assures a healthy future for wolves in the northern rockies
