 referring to the 1992 earth summit in rio de janeiro he said we were in manado to correct a 17yearold oversight “world leaders signed landmark agreements to halt the loss of biodiversity to safeguard the world’s climate and to better manage the world’s forests” he said “but they signed no agreement on the one environment that covers about 72 percent of the earth’s surface and provides sustenance to humankind – the oceans” correcting that oversight begins with the coral triangle initiative but the story doesn’t start and end in manado as with many conservation successes this achievement has taken decades of committed effort from the ground and water up  began working in this part of the world in the 1970s with a focus on spees conservation and marine protected areas in the 1990s we scaled up to the ecoregional level thanks to support from many donors among them the us agency for international development national oceanic and atmospheric administration state department global environment fality and asian development bank as well as the packard foundation macarthur foundation and individual donors since that time we’ve built up programs across the region with a focus on the importance of conservation in protecting the livelihoods of the people who live there we scaled up further as we realized that the several contiguous ecoregions were in fact one spectacularly large and interconnected ecological complex in 2007  joined forces with  and  together we have expanded conservation in the area and promoted to the world the astonishing biological value of the region it takes a herculean effort on the part of many to make a highlevel multinational collaboration like this take shape  technical experts have delivered the sentific and economic arguments in favor of conservation our policy and regional spealists met repeatedly and for many long hours in discussions with local and national government offials to help lay out the possibilities and the payoffs given the limited resources of the coral triangle governments we advocated for support from the us government and through our global network from other governments and multinational funding agenes following the december 2007 launch of the coral triangle initiative in bali we spent another year and a half working with the governments as they developed and refined their plans from summit to action the new 10year regional coral triangle initiative plan of action centers on five goals building networks of marine protected areas scaling fisheries management up to the level of ecosystems protecting endangered spees integrating conservation across seascapes and helping spees and communities adapt to the impacts of climate change an extraordinary amount of collaboration went into developing the plan in a remarkably short period the result is impressive it includes detailed targets for each goal at the level of the entire region and a suite of national action plans for meeting those targets it’s more than a plan however as expressed by prime minister derek sikua of the solomon islands “the coral triangle initiative is a dream come true for the countries  it is no longer an idea  it is reality  let us cherish this reality as we drive this dream forward let us ensure that it will always be the livelihood of our people that will motivate us and energize us to implement the ideals of this newfound entity”
