 most people are aware of the need to protect the world’s great rainforests for some years the consequences of widespread deforestation – loss of habitat and damage to valuable ecosystems that regulate freshwater supply – have been wellpublized the close critical link between rainforests and climate change is less well known however deforestation is one of the biggest sources of atmospheric carbon responsible for 20 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions the world’s tropical forests store a massive 210 billion tons of carbon it is released into the atmosphere when trees and brushwood are burned during clearing operations a further 500 million tons of carbon are present in the forest floor some of which subsequently escapes when cleared ground is prepared for crop planting the future of rainforests is of double environmental significance therefore with implications that transcend national and even regional boundaries ’s forestbased carbon vision no net greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and degradation extreme weather events and other realities of climate change have heightened public awareness of the dangers ahead and strengthened the political will to tackle carbon emissions negotiations to reach a post2012 agreement on implementing the second phase of the kyoto protocol presents a unique window of opportunity to tackle an important source of emissions and a major conservation issue in one sweep forest stewardship counl fsc wscorg a rcle of green three great forests form a “rcle of green” around the equator their environmental roles of climate regulators and protectors of much of biodiversity are threatened by rampant logging mining hunting agriculture and general encroachment our heart of borneo project aims to secure the future of one of the largest remaining pristine rainforests through collaboration between the governments of brunei indonesia and malaysia implementation of responsible business practices and income generated through properly managed natural resources central africa is a haven for indigenous people elephants gorillas and a multitude of exotic wildlife our congo basin – green heart of africa project aims to align economic forces with conservation so that by 2020 at least 20 per cent of the region’s ecosystems are protected local people are managing their own resources in effient ways and at least half of all logging is independently certified as sustainable despite decades of deforestation 80 per cent of the amazon rainforest remains virtually untouched our amazon project aims to secure completion of the amazon regional protected area arpa programme preserving 50 million hectares of brazilian rainforest by greatly increasing the number and size of protected areas another regional goal is to lessen deforestation pressures by ensuring fewer agricultural clearances we are encouraging “wise use” programmes such as those advocated by the forest stewardship counl to ensure the environmentally sound soally benefial and economically viable management of forest resources
