  recently made sustainable communities and smart growth a top priority why now the initiative is the outcome of years of intense work on several fronts smartgrowth planning in california the recently launched leed certification program for neighborhood development transportation reform environmental justice and community revitalization meanwhile we have a window of opportunity right now to make significant progress president obama has created the partnership for sustainable communities a very active interagency effort to provide federal support for localities that want to offer walkable neighborhoods and cleaner transportation options regions and munipalities all over the country are much more engaged in smartgrowth planning than they have been in the past how did you get involved in these issues i joined  in the early 1980s as a litigator focusing on forestry and agriculture and later became the first director of the land program in the 1990s i started focusing on transportation which is ultimately about land use around the same time other groups including the environmental protection agency the state of maryland and the national trust were getting interested in smarter landuse planning as well a movement was born and  was at the center of it why are sustainable communities so vital they address several of our biggest environmental challenges at once greenhouse gas emissions land consumption and the protection of open space wildlife habitat and watersheds studies show that half the built environment we will have in 25 years has yet to be built so there is a lot of potential for sweeping change fundamentally i believe in the concept of community and creating places where people can walk to things and have interactions along the way that will lead to a better life to do that we’ve got to provide people with more transportation choices what strategies are you pursuing we’re urging congress to pass a federal transportation bill that will dramatically cut global warming pollution and oil consumption and create millions of new jobs in california we’re advanng the implementation of a groundbreaking bill that requires regional planning to incorporate transportation alternatives that minimize carbon emissions meanwhile we’re working closely with the private sector—architects planners and developers—to incorporate smartgrowth prinples in a largescale way this collaboration led to the launch of leedneighborhood development in april 2010 and its acceptance as federal policy—arguably the biggest development in smart growth in a decade what makes leednd such a major milestone for the first time we have a consensusbased set of standards to determine what is “smart” and “green” about smart green development such as location transportation walkability green buildings and stormwater control already leednd is being picked up in influential ways by both the private sector and government the us department of housing and urban development has announced it is going to use leednd location criteria in evaluating some 325 billion worth of grant proposals annually sprawl has been the prevailing model for a long time but we’re pioneering a new model for development
