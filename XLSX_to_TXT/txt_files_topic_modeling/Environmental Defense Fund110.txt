 for 40 years the law that was supposed to protect americans from dangerous chemicals in everyday products simply didn’t work the toxic substances control act of 1976 was so badly broken that it left the environmental protection agency unable to regulate even known carnogens like asbestos still numerous efforts to reform the law failed all that changed in 2016 when congress passed a sweeping overhaul it’s the biggest improvement to a major environmental law since the clean air act and safe drinking water act were amended a generation ago and  was at the center of it “it took bipartisan leadership stakeholders willing to seek common ground and many years to reform this dysfunctional law” says  biochemist dr richard denison who spent 15 years pressing for change “this adventure had more close shaves than a jason bourne movie” the road to reform goes back to 1997 when  published toxic ignorance a seminal report revealing that basic health data were lacking for many chemicals we use every day at the time denison was trying to help companies identify safer chemicals but without data it couldn’t be done by 2008 he was posting detailed critiques of epa’s chemicals program on a blog that became a mustread for congressional staffers industry insiders and environmental advocates in 2013 senators frank lautenberg dnj and david vitter rla introduced a bipartisan albeit flawed reform bill when lautenberg died senator tom udall dnm took up the cause denison provided expert advice to members of both parties and  worked tirelessly to improve the bill and broaden support with partners like the march of dimes the work paid off the muchimproved frank r lautenberg chemical safety for the 21st century act was brought to the senate floor by unanimous consent and passed on a voice vote the house voted in favor by an overwhelming 403 to 12 in june 2016 president obama signed it into law epa is now required to review the safety of chemicals already in use as well as the approximately 700 new chemicals introduced each year before they come on the market and epa finally has the power to ban dangerous chemicals from everyday products
