 annual reports celebrate achievements of the past year and in the case of  those conservation achievements can be inspiring our supporters should be proud of what they have enabled us to achieve in securing lands and waters on which all life depends but we sometimes shortchange the underlying strengths and values that enable the conservancy to be successful strong and transparent governance as a concept does not inspire awe nor does it appeal to emotions as our conservation achievements do nevertheless good governance is one of our strengths and is crual to our success as an institution our record of effective and effient governance allows us to engage and maintain longterm relationships with both local and global institutions—from local land trusts to usaid and government agenes in the us latin america europe australia and asia when we engage in capaty building with younger nongovernmental organizations around the world we help instill prinples of good governance that will enhance their effectiveness and garner trust from their constituenes as well and handinhand with governance is strong management of finances and projects the conservancy has also become the industry leader in conceptualizing testing and sharing creative methods to finance conservation from our earliest establishment of a revolving land preservation fund through debtfornature swaps conservation trust funds and matchingfund programs to leverage public support with private dollars the conservancy has always sought to maximize our donors’ generosity most recently we have focused on expanding such sustainable finance options as water funds whereby urban water users finance upstream conservation action as a costeffective means to ensure ongoing freshwater supplies in coastal marine habitats we are applying market approaches to incentivize conservation by fishers and cooperatives and we are exploring the emerging carbon market as a means of sustainable funding for conservation across vast landscapes from australia to africa it is this behindthescenes displine research experimentation and negotiation that led ultimately to the conservation achievements we cheer we remain grateful to our supporters who understand the investment it takes to stay ahead of the challenges to our natural world and we pledge to always value the sacrifice you and your families make to enable our efforts to continue
