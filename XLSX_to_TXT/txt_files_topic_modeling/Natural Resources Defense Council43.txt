 experts have warned that were in the midst of a serious biodiversity crisis what does this mean for our bears wolves and coyotes historically large carnivores across the world have been greatly persecuted and many have been pushed to the brink of extinction thats a serious problem espeally because large carnivore spees often play an outsize role in maintaining balanced ecosystems we should consider them our allies in combating the biodiversity crisis despite recovery efforts in the united states many of these unique animals still occupy just a fraction of their former range which has major impacts on the landscape are humans also at risk if we lose these spees the lives of humans and large carnivores are not inherently at odds to the contrary they are intertwined i was reminded of this last fall when i visited the spring camp of the dukha an ethnic minority group whose livelihood in mongolias northern taiga is tied to reindeer herding and subsistence hunting the dukha routinely move their herds and use fenng and dogs to protect the reindeer from wolves but they believe that wolves also add invaluable benefits to their lives for example by controlling the spread of disease they see predation as one aspect of a giveandtake relationship with their environment they dont frame that relationship in terms of conflict is humanwildlife strife a significant factor in the slow pace of the comeback for carnivores in the west yes animals like grizzly bears and wolves are still being killed in alarming numbers today because of real or perceived conflicts with humans in places like the northern rockies these events often take the form of carnivores killing livestock and government agenes or individual landowners killing carnivores in response this creates a toxic cycle of killing that results in losses to ranchers and wildlife enthusiasts alike  is helping to break that cycle by getting ahead of the conflicts and encouraging proactive strategies and polies that allow humans livestock and native carnivores to share the landscape more harmoniously what kinds of nonlethal tools do we have to prevent these conflicts instead of waiting for losses to occur we are equipping ranchers with spealized fenng that can protect their vulnerable livestock from predation take turbo fladry which is composed of nylon flags sewn onto electrified polywire and capitalizes on wolves fear of the unfamiliar the flags scare wolves to the point where they wont cross over or under the wire we use this tool to strategically enclose livestock pastures during certain seasons and so far have had complete success in preventing livestock losses inside an enclosure youve said before  wildlife brings people together what do you mean by that in these divisive times we have seen that we can successfully build partnerships with unlikely allies to make positive changes for both people and wildlife here and now it takes time but our work is changing the status quo by collaborating with federal and state agenes tribal nations communities and individuals we are moving toward a nonlethalfirst approach to living with wildlife we are showing people that killing is not the only option for responding to conflicts many americans would probably say they want their grandkids to be able to see a grizzly bear or a puma in the wild someday what will carnivores most need from us to ensure their survival over the next 50 years grizzly bears and other spees need large connected landscapes to thrive it wont work to draw lines around small isolated pockets of wilderness and say this is where grizzly bears get to live it can be hard to think big picture and long term about wildlife conservation but i see more and more emphasis on the importance of large landscape connectivity in montana for example our conflict prevention work is helping to create more space for large carnivores allowing them to move safely between areas of core habitat we are laying the groundwork to help reconnect populations and increase their resiliency
