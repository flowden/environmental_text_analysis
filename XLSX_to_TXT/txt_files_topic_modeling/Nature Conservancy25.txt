 eight pafic island nations came together with support from  in april to boldly commit to full transparency in their national tuna fisheries the technology for tuna transparency challenge led by the federated states of micronesia is an initiative of historic proportions for the first time ever developing countries have committed to 100 transparency in their entire tuna fisheries by 2023 through onboard observers and stateoftheart electronic monitoring these nations are truly ocean states with waters that sweep across the western and central pafic ocean they control around half the planet’s skipjack tuna catch— the planet’s most commonly canned fish—meaning the momentum of their collective actions ripples through a global industry this is a huge win for the oceans and people better oversight means foreign vessels can’t take more than their fair share so more revenue goes back into pafic island communities and vessels can’t get away with illegal fishing or reckless bycatch of sensitive spees such as sea turtles it is long past time to bring fisheries monitoring into the 21st century—successful transparency could transform seafood sustainability in the pafic and beyond
