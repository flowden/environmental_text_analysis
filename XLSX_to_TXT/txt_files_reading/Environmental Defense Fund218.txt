 china burns over half the world’s coal. and though coal has fueled prosperity, it is also the primary reason that china tops the list of the world’s worst carbon polluters. in 2013, with edf’s help, china launched the first of seven carbon trading pilot programs designed to clear the air by improving energy efficiency and accelerating the shift to cleaner energy sources such as wind. the pilots will eventually cover 250 million people in shenzhen, beijing, chongqing, shanghai, tianjin, and the provinces of guangdong and hubei. edf began a formal collaboration with shenzhen last november, providing technical support and training to officials designing the first pilot. the project will limit emissions from 635 companies responsible for about 40% of the city’s carbon pollution. companies able to reduce their emissions below their limit can sell unused permits to companies unable to meet their targets— creating a financial incentive to reduce emissions while ensuring strong environmental results. edf also helped broker an agreement between shenzhen and california, the first u.s. state to develop its own state-of-the-art emissions trading system. this cooperation opens the door to work on a range of low-carbon strategies, from carbon trading to electric vehicles. “we cannot stabilize global climate without a targeted and rigorous campaign to curb carbon pollution in china. the seven new pilots are the boldest experiment yet in that direction.” daniel dudek , edf vice president
