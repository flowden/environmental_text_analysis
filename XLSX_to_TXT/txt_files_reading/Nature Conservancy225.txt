 in 1961, the conservancy received its first donated conservation easement from corrine gallup on land in stonington, connecticut, on the mystic river. the easement allows the landowner to retain title to the ecologically valuable property while giving the nature conservancy the right to enforce controls on certain types of harmful activities. after land acquisition, conservation easement became the conservancy’s most prominent conservation tool in its first decades. in recent years, the conservancy has worked to establish or strengthen laws supporting the conservation easement concept in other countries — including mexico, chile and australia — to encourage private citizens and others to conserve natural landholdings in perpetuity.
