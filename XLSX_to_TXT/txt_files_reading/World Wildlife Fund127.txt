 an oregon department of fish and wildlife staffer inspects a fish aboard a dory boat off pacific city, oregon. the us imports more than 5.3 billion pounds of seafood annually. up to a third comes from ships engaging in ilegal or unreported fishing. but a new us government rule released in december 2016 aims to prevent illegally caught fish from winding up in us grocery stores and restaurants. the rule focuses on 12 groups of marine species, including king crab and grouper. once it’s enacted, importers of those species will be required to have traceability systems that show the seafood’s legal origins, from catch to first point of sale in the us. the rule—supported by 750,000 wwf activists—is a huge victory for protecting vulnerable marine species.
