 epa’s mercury and air toxics standards, one of the greatest public health advances in a generation, will eliminate 90% of mercury emissions from power plants and prevent up to 11,000 premature deaths annually. edf and allies worked for a decade to secure this victory for americans in 2011. now the coal lobby is trying to kill these mercury rules before they are fully implemented, but edf’s legal team is committed to defending the standards. “they have more money and more lawyers, but we have the law and facts on our side,” says edf general counsel vickie patton.
