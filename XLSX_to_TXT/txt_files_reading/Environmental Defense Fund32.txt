 for years, forward-looking companies have cut their carbon footprints. now, some are also stepping up to lobby for federal action on climate. at the forefront is the ceo climate dialogue, an alliance of leaders from 18 powerful companies, including dupont, exelon and ford. their goal: an economywide price on carbon. edf and partners recruited companies and helped develop the group’s guiding principles. meanwhile, several major automakers, galvanized by edf and others, spoke out in support of clean car rules that the trump administration seeks to weaken. and we persuaded bp and shell to fight the rollback of federal methane standards. as these battles rage on, such businesses will be important allies. edf also helps companies cut their own greenhouse gas emissions, including by advising walmart’s suppliers on how to contribute to the retailer’s ambitious billion-ton reduction goal — more than the annual emissions of germany. edf accepts no money from its corporate partners. says amanda sourry, president of unilever north america and ceo climate dialogue member: “the cost of inaction is greater than the cost of action on climate change.”
