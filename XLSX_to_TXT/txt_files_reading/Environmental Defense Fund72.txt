 houston is dr. loren raun’s city—and her laboratory. for 20 years, she has researched the health effects of air pollution in houston, which once vied with los angeles for dirtiest air. she has studied air quality and cardiac arrest, estimated the cost of asthma attacks triggered by pollution and identified high-risk asthma days. soon, dr. raun, the chief environmental science officer for the houston health department, will be getting data she could only have dreamed of a few years ago. building on our work monitoring air quality using sensors mounted on google street view cars, edf helped install sensors on vehicles in houston’s municipal fleet. our research with the vehicle technology company geotab shows that just 10 to 20 carefully selected municipal vehicles could map air quality for 70 percent of a city while following their normal routes. “public fleets could become the eyes and noses of their cities,” says edf’s aileen nowlan. their data could jump-start clean air measures such as bike infrastructure, congestion relief and freight electrification. dr. raun can’t wait to start working with the new data. “improving our ability to measure air pollution improves our ability to manage it,” she says.
