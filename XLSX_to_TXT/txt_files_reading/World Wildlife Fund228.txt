 in a small village in midwestern nepal, thagiya tharu smiles as she ignites her biogas cookstove. she and her husband, mohan, were among the first in their community to embrace biogas as an alternative to firewood, saving themselves countless hours of wood collecting, eliminating health-impairing wood smoke from the house, and conserving their beloved forests. thagiya and mohan are two of the many beneficiaries of wwf’s gold standard biogas ver project in nepal’s terai arc landscape, which is home to 7 million people as well as tigers, rhinos and elephants. during the first phase of the project, which launched in june, wwf- nepal helped install 7,500 biogas plants, which mix animal dung and water in a digester to produce methane—a gas that burns with a bright blue flame. by 2020, wwf-nepal and nepal’s alternative energy promotion centre plan to extend access to biogas plants to as many as 20,000 more households across the terai arc. the vision of so many more transformative blue flames flickering is a fitting one for a country where wwf has been working since the 1960s.
