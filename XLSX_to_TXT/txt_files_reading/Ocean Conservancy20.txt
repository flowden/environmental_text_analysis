 2017 was a politically charged year in the u.s., which saw attacks launched on long-standing, science-based ocean priorities that previously enjoyed bipartisan support. yet we know that the ocean is a potent rallying point around which people of many perspectives can unite to transcend political discord today. from communities concerned about healthy fish stocks, to coastal areas facing ocean acidification, to sailors and divers seeing first-hand the impacts of plastics in the ocean, ocean conservancy is working with renewed effort to elevate voices from our diverse network of ocean champions to find common ground and to defend the core ocean conservation programs upon which so many of our livelihoods, communities and personal sense of wonder all depend. for instance, this year, we brought together philippe cousteau, grandson of oceanographer jacques cousteau, and rep. carlos curbelo (r-fl) — two leaders from different political parties — to discuss non-partisan solutions to our most pressing ocean conservation issues. creating productive partnerships that rise above the political fray, and offer real options for durable ocean wins, will be an ongoing priority.
