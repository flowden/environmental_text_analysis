 a federal court dealt a significant blow to the dirty tar sands pipeline in august 2018, stating that the trump administration broke the law when hastily approving the project. though this controversial pipeline—which would carry up to 35 million gallons a day of canadian tar sands oil—had its permit denied by the obama administration more than three years ago, president trump revived the project from the dead as one of his first executive actions. despite the challenges of fighting a corporate behemoth, keystone xl’s many foes, including nrdc, refuse to give up. trump and his corporate allies made little progress toward their goal as they strove to ram their project through during the administration’s first two years in office. in november, in another ruling on the case brought by nrdc and partners, a federal judge blocked construction on the pipeline. the u.s. district court ruled that the trump administration had relied on an outdated environmental review from 2014— which violates the national environmental policy act, the endangered species act, and the administrative procedure act. the judge then ordered the u.s. department of state to stop all construction and revise its environmental review. dena hoff, a montana farmer and member­ leader of the northern plains resource council, one of the plaintiffs in nrdc’s lawsuit, called the ruling “a victory for common­ sense stewardship of the land and water upon which we all depend,” emphasizing the high stakes in this decade long battle. “despite the best efforts of wealthy multinational corporations and the powerful politicians who cynically do their bidding,” she said, “we see that everyday people can still band together and successfully defend their rights.”
