 “when i realized i had diabetes type 2, i knew immediately it was related to the life i was living in the city. so i decided to go back to my roots. but when i returned, things had changed; fi shes were decreasing in size and could no longer support the growing number of people in the village. something had to be done to save our fi shes from extinction. the idea of biodiversity conservation and sustainable resource management applied by the conservancy recognizes all aspects of our life. it respects the different types and uses of our land and sea. it reinforces our cultural identities, deals with sustainable use of our resources and respect for the environment, and gives prominence to our traditions, especially the harvesting methods, the spears and traditional nets.” powesiu lawes is a retired medical doctor. his village, loniu, is within the boundaries of the coral triangle support partnership, where the conservancy works with partners to facilitate community support for local management practices. dr. lawes brought this initiative to loniu in 2010 with the belief that traditional fi shing methods always ensure that there are enough fi sh for another day. two years later, dr. lawes reports that fi sh have increased, and that communities are witnessing the benefi ts of sustainable resource management.
