 with water in the west chronically overallocated, edf is engaging stakeholders to adopt flexible water management. for almost half a century, the colorado river has rarely run its full course to mexico’s gulf of california. but in 2014, it did, thanks to a deal edf helped broker. a “pulse flow” of water, designed to mimic spring floods, was released into the dry riverbed. it’s now providing scientists with clues on how to revitalize the delta. smaller releases are planned for the next two years. the water came back because the united states and mexico came together to share water, benefiting farmers as well as communities and wildlife. delta inhabitants celebrated the return of the river with brass bands.
