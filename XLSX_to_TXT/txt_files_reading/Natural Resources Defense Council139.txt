 on a hot and humid afternoon last june, we traveled to georgetown university to hear president obama announce a bold plan for addressing climate change. halfway through the speech, the president outlined an approach to cutting carbon pollution from power plants that sounded familiar: nrdc had designed the model and proved it would work. we were thrilled to hear the president’s endorsement. after all, naysayers had told us this victory was impossible. but nrdc upended conventional wisdom. we devised a plan that broke the logjam on climate action. this june, the environmental protection agency will propose limits on carbon from power plants that will help make the air safer to breathe and protect communities from extreme weather. carbon limits will move america down the path toward a more sustainable future. and at every turn, nrdc will help guide the way. we push forward— holding polluters accountable, revealing scientific truths, designing innovative solutions—for a simple reason. we want our children and grandchildren to inherit a world with clean air, safe water, wild places, and a stable climate. we know this future is possible, but we have to foster it. that is what nrdc does. we help communities choose clean power over dirty fuels, safe products over toxic chemicals, strong protections over empty oceans. and together with our board of trustees and dedicated members and supporters, we are honoring our obligation to future generations.
