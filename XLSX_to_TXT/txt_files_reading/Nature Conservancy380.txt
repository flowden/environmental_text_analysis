 the atlantic forest once stretched across 330 million acres of brazil, argentina, and paraguay. today, although 93 percent of this moist tropical forest has been cleared, its fragmented remains still harbor nearly as much biological diversity as the amazon. the conservancy is working to restore this habitat by providing incentives for large-scale conservation, such as forest easements and carbon credits, and implementing a billion-tree reforestation effort. to supplement these conservation strategies, the conservancy supports a variety of eco-friendly small businesses, such as rosali cordeiro eurich’s co-op, to create “buffer zones” around parks and other protected areas.
