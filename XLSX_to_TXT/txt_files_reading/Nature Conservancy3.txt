 for decades, residents in the former mining town of trinidad, colo., had been watch- ing young people leave for distant job opportunities. in 2017, mayor phil rico decided to approach tnc and the trust for public land (tpl) with a plan for change: would the organizations help protect a neighboring ranch with an eye toward transforming the city into a thriving hub for outdoor recreation? last year, that vision came to life when the property was made into a state park crowned by the 9,633-foot fishers peak. after tnc and tpl purchased the 19,200-acre ranch with support from great outdoors colorado, the two groups helped colorado parks and wildlife acquire the $25.4 million property and transform it into fishers peak state park. it promises to become an outdoor tourism destination on par with the scenic natural wonders that already contribute $62 billion to the state’s economy. the park is home to more than 900 species—including elk, bobcat and peregrine falcon—and helps secure a wildlife corridor from the sangre de cristo mountains to the grasslands of the high plains. “by planning for both ecological and recreational goals from the ground floor, we’ll strive to show how solid conservation outcomes contribute to an economically thriving community, all while connecting future generations to nature,” says matt moorhead, tnc’s conservation partnerships advisor in colorado.
