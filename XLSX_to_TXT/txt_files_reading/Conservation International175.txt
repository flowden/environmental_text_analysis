 a healthy seafood sector is not just about the fish. over the next year, we will pilot the rapid assessment protocol across a few key areas where we work, in hopes that our blueprint for stronger fisheries can be used elsewhere by others. itâ€™s about the people who catch and process it for our consumption. persistent human rights violations in the seafood industry, however, are undermining food security and driving social instability, poverty and even slavery. to tackle this problem, we are helping to embed improved human rights in places where we work to improve fisheries through a new, collaboratively developed rapid assessment protocol for socially responsible seafood. this new approach aims to increase transparency in seafood supply chains by providing governments, companies and fishers with the skills and data they need to ensure that their catch is environmentally sustainable and socially responsible.
