 after decades of seclusion, myanmar (previously known as burma) is experiencing a dramatic shift from military rule to democracy and from a centrally controlled economy to a market-oriented one. although ethnic conflicts are occurring amid this change, myanmar’s long period of isolation has left the nation relatively undeveloped compared with its neighbors and many of its natural resources remain intact. there is much at stake. with extensive forests and three economically, ecologically and culturally important rivers (irrawaddy, mekong and myintnge), myanmar is one of the most biologically diverse countries in southeast asia. seventy percent of myanmar’s citizens are dependent on its forests for their livelihoods, and river fish are the primary source of protein for its people. the country is also one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change in the world. through our leadership of the responsible asia forestry and trade (raft) program, tnc has been working to reduce tropical deforestation and forest degradation in myanmar and the asia pacific region. building on this foundation, we will expand our work in central myanmar to focus on: strengthening the management of forests to conserve the country’s rich biological and cultural assets while ensuring that the forests continue to make a valuable contribution to the country’s economic development. protecting the health and productivity of free-flowing rivers to maximize benefits for communities and nature.
