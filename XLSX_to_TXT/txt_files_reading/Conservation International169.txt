 the french territory announced tougher protections for 10,000 square miles of waters, home to unique coral habitats and more than 9,000 marine species. conservation international staff were instrumental in making this happen — the result of years of diligent engagement with local communities and policymakers. but our oceans work was not confined to conference rooms and community centers. we got our feet wet in 2018, seeking new insights into iconic marine species, a bellwether for ocean health. last year, a team of conservation international scientists and local government officials were diving near triton bay in west papua, indonesia, to document a school of whale sharks, the largest fish in the ocean, when they spotted a female. little is known about female whale sharks, which are rarely seen in the wild. the team sprang into action, painlessly affixing a satellite tag onto the shark’s dorsal fin. data from this tag will shed some light on this charismatic species. thanks to our work, new caledonia moved to protect some of the world’s last near-pristine coral reefs.
