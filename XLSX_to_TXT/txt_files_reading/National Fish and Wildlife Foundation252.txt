 the national fish and wildlife foundation’s targeted watershed grant (twg) program, a partnership with the environmental protection agency, is measurably reducing the flow of nitrogen and phosphorus into the chesapeake bay. the overload of these two nutrients is the prime culprit in the degradation of the bay’s environment, and reducing their presence is a primary conservation goal. it is estimated that on an annual basis about 285 million pounds of nitrogen and 19 million pounds of phosphorus make it into the bay through runoff and atmospheric deposition. conservation partners have set the ambitious target of reducing this load to 175 million and 12.8 million pounds annually, respectively. thus, the goal is to remove the difference: 11 0 million pounds of nitrogen and 6.2 million pounds of phosphorus. the projected benefits from twg projects funded in 2007 amount to nearly 1.4 million pounds of nitrogen and 650,000 pounds of phosphorus. that represents 1.25% of the nitrogen goal and 10.5% of the phosphorus goal. since the twg program’s onset in 2006, nfwf has supported projects that, if successful, will prevent 6.6 million pounds of nitrogen and 4 million pounds of phosphorus from entering the bay—that’s 6% of the total nitrogen reduction goal and a staggering 65% of the phosphorus reduction goal. keystones represent a core portfolio of issue-specific programs with clear, long-term goals and well-articulated strategies to achieve meaningful and measurable conservation outcomes. through keystones, the national fish and wildlife foundation proactively identifies grantees, evaluates best practices and innovative solutions, and enters into strategic alliances with partners to help “move the needle” on important conservation issues. together with our other grant programs, the keystones will shape nfwf’s conservation agenda in the years ahead.
