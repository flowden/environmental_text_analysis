 american forests celebrated its 138th birthday in 2013 and it was a year of both focusing and expanding our efforts. over the past 12 months, we reached an important milestone in our restoration tree planting efforts: planting our 45 millionth tree since 1990. these efforts will result in cleaner air to breathe, cleaner water to drink and expanded habitat for countless animals, from bears to birds to butterflies. we launched a vital new program to help cities evaluate their urban forest needs, and help community tree planting groups expand tree canopies. we expanded our community of concerned citizens, hosting volunteer events across the country and engaging tens of thousands of people through social media.
