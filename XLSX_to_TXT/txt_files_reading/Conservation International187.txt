 in the past year, conservation international made dramatic advances in our scientific understanding of the impermanence of protected areas around the world â€” a phenomenon known as protected area downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (paddd). our research continues to influence the media narrative about the recent reductions of two national monuments in the united states, the largest such reductions in u.s. history. conservation international scientists published a new study showing that the effectiveness of protected areas in brazil influences their legal durability; the loss of these protections could have long-term deleterious effects in amazonian forests and prompt losses in protected areas elsewhere. we also published a working paper examining cases of paddd within unesco world heritage sites. in the coming year, we expect to publish a global review of paddd, with comprehensive regional results for amazonia and the united states.
