 forests help stabilize the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. burning or razing forests emits the stored carbon dioxide, one of the greenhouse gases that causes climate change. in fact, greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation are at least 20 percent of the global total—more than all the world’s cars, trucks and airplanes combined. ci works with partners from government leaders to local farmers to protect and restore forests. in brazil, the governor of pará state made an unprecedented pledge to conserve an area of the amazon large enough to be seen from space. creating the seven new protected areas took major financial and technical support from ci’s global conservation fund (gcf), the gordon and betty moore foundation, ci-brazil and its local partner imazon—showing how broad partnerships can bring change on a global scale. worldwide, we are implementing forest carbon projects in partnership with government, international, corporate and local stakeholders that benefit biodiversity, communities and the climate. in eastern madagascar, we are working with the government and local communities to link three national reserves into a 4,250-square kilometer conservation corridor that helps lemurs and other threatened wildlife survive while maintaining the natural resources and services that sustain local people. ci also works with partners to devise innovative financing mechanisms for protecting tropical forests. a debt-for-nature swap using gcf funding will enable the guatemalan government to invest more than $24 million to help protect threatened forest in four areas over the next 15 years. the agreement with the u.s. and guatemalan governments and the nature conservancy designated $19.5 million to finance grants for eligible nongovernment projects, and the remaining $4.9 million created a permanent conservation trust fund that will generate interest for future grants.
