 a sampling of accomplishments for the year illustrates the expanding ways we seek to build a constituency for conservation—from education, volunteerism and social media outreach to convening decision-makers. corporate engagement provided expanded outreach opportunities, including with lowe’s to catalyze school garden builds and revitalizations in more than 50 schools in underserved communities across the country; with pepsico’s recycle for nature campaign to protect drinking water through recycling and save at least 1.2 billion gallons of water over five years; and with some 80 brewers in 25 states, from deschutes to dogfish head, through oktoberforest, a campaign to raise awareness and support healthy forests and clean water. the nature conservancy in china is leading the organization in its digital outreach to raise public awareness and education in support of nature. among its successful campaigns has been the joint outreach with united nations environment and the international fund for animal welfare for world wildlife day 2017, where tnc collaborated with more than 30 celebrities to reach at least half a billion people in china. the conservancy is connecting people to nature in chicago’s diverse communities through volunteerism. tnc partnered with the chicago park district to expand volunteer opportunities by hosting 400-plus workdays last year. more than 8,500 volunteers contributed over 20,000 hours to this effort. africa’s great lakes hold one-third of the world’s surface fresh water. the nature conservancy spearheaded the african great lakes conference, an unprecedented gathering on the ugandan shores of lake victoria, bringing together those who best understand the challenges these seven major lakes face and those who can put into practice activities to lessen those threats. critical to the conference’s success was a collaboration with tnc’s north american great lakes team.
