 with your help, environmental defense fund has successfully held the line against the trump administration’s attempts to roll back bipartisan environmental safeguards over the past two years. the makeup of the new congress means there will be greater oversight of these protections. but edf has never been just about defense. we’ve never stopped making progress. and we’re making progress today— with companies, states and other countries—thanks in part to innovations that are supercharging our ability to solve problems. the stakes are high. recent scientific reports show that air pollution is killing seven million people a year, the world is losing wildlife and ocean life at an alarming rate, and the window of time remaining to avert dangerous climate change is rapidly closing. in response, edf has raised its ambitions. for example, we are preparing to launch a satellite to expose and reduce methane pollution, which causes more than one-quarter of today’s global warming. already, state action on methane has been prompted by the data we’ve collected using advanced sensors, planes and drones. that’s how innovation leads to impact, from our earliest cases that laid the foundation of environmental law to the latest promise of high technology. with each wave of progress, we’ve gained new tools to build on our established strengths. you’ll see examples of such innovations throughout this report. thank you for your support that has made this progress possible.
