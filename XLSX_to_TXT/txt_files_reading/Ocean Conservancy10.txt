 this year, ocean conservancy joined an expedition to st. helena — one of the world’s remotest islands — that revealed ocean plastics on every beach, threatening important foraging grounds for whale sharks. for the first time in our international coastal cleanup’s 33-year history, all top-10 most common items collected by volunteers around the world were made of plastic — a stunning fact raising even more concerns about the global scale of plastic pollution. through our trash free seas alliance®, we are working with scientists, industry leaders and nonprofits to inform solutions. one big win in our shared fight came when corporate alliance partners like coca-cola, danone, dow, pepsico and procter & gamble collectively committed more than $100 million in funding for research and incubation of scalable solutions to the ocean plastic crisis. in addition, they pledged to eliminate half a million tons of virgin plastic from products and packaging each year. through these and other actions, we are leading the way among an expanded cadre dedicated to stemming the tide on ocean plastic.
