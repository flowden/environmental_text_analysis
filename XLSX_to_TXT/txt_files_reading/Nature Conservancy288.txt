 the world is changing more rapidly each day. fast-paced development threatens some of our most cherished lands, waterways and species. over the next two decades, energy and mining companies will invest more than $20 trillion in projects around the world, with the potential for enormous environmental impacts. the nature conservancy has a unique opportunity to face this development challenge head on. by working with regulatory agencies and energy and mining companies, the conservancy can better protect natural areas by creating plans to mitigate for environmental damage before it happens. this proactive—rather than the typically reactive—approach will allow the conservancy to steer development projects away from conservation priorities and identify additional conservation actions companies can take to offset their impacts on the environment. taking this step will result in better outcomes for conservation and ensure the preservation of many threatened landscapes for future generations.
