 the fishing industry supports hundreds of millions of jobs worldwide, and billions of people get their protein from the sea. but one-third of fisheries worldwide have been pushed beyond their limits, and the blackmarket fish trade—worth more than $36 billion every year—is further straining those precious resources. to turn the crisis around, wwf has been collaborating on the development of technologies that increase transparency in the fishing industry. an online tool named “detect it: fish” uses big data to spot discrepancies in reported import and export data, which could be indicators of illegal activity. launched in november 2017 by wwf and traffic, and powered by hpe vertica, detect it: fish helps authorities more efficiently deploy their limited resources for investigations. in the pacific, wwf is working with industry partners to pilot the application of blockchain technology to trace tuna from origin to sale. blockchain’s virtually tamper-proof digital records provide the market with information that can engender greater trust in a product’s origin.
