 edf is fighting to end irresponsible natural gas development through strong regulation and industry partnerships. among 2013’s successes: pennsylvania: we helped create the center for sustainable shale development, establishing 15 leading practices for shale gas development. the program will include thirdparty audit, much as green building council oversees leed standards for buildings. the washington post called the center “a heartening breakthrough in the war over fracking.” texas: the state thoroughly overhauled its outdated well construction requirements. the improvements included many ideas contained in a model regulatory framework developed by edf and southwestern energy. the new regulations will increase protections for groundwater and serve as a model for other states. now we’re helping texas focus on the issue of wastewater disposal. wyoming: we partnered with local environmental groups to successfully advocate new measures to reduce air pollution. we also helped governor matt mead (r) draft sound rules for protecting groundwater.
