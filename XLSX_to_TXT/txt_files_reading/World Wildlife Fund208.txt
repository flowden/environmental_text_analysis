 although china is the world’s largest producer and consumer of paper products, the practice of responsible forest management is not yet widespread there. but that may be changing soon, thanks to a new, multiyear initiative launched in collaboration with apple inc. this groundbreaking partnership to catalyze responsible forestry in china will help the country reduce its environmental footprint by producing paper products from responsibly managed forests within its own borders. as a result, the country could conserve as much as 1 million acres of forests, showcase its ability to reduce the land and water used to produce paper while creating less pollution, and still meet the growing demand for paper products. | by 2020, up to 296,000 acres of working forests in china—the plantations and semi-natural forests that supply pulp and paper manufacturers—could receive forest stewardship council (fsc) certification, which means the product comes from a responsibly managed forest that follows rigorous standards for environmental and social responsibility. | this project also represents the dynamic role companies can play in protecting forests, and is a step toward guiding more of china’s pulp and paper supply chain to responsible forestry efforts on its own land. launched in 2015, the china sustainable paper alliance will help clarify china’s pulp and paper needs and increase the percentage of those products created inside china in a responsible, sustainable way. keila hand, manager of paper sector engagement for wwf, meets with wwf-china’s mingming sun (at left) and representatives from zaozhuang huarun paper company, ltd., to discuss the many sources of wood, pulp, and paper—whether domestic or foreign— that can feed more sustainability and transparency in china’s paper sector.
