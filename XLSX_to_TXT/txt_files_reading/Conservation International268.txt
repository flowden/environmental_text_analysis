 for pacific island states, the failing health of the oceans and the specter of climate change loom large. left unchecked, these forces threaten lives, livelihoods—even the existence of the nations themselves. but for the 15 members of the pacific islands leadership forum that endorsed its creation, the pacific oceanscape heralds a new era of cooperation and security. the framework for the long-term, sustainable management of 38.4 million square kilometers (nearly 15 million square miles)—an area comparatively larger than the land area of canada, the u.s. and mexico combined—represents not only the largest marine conservation initiative in history, but also a new commitment among pacific island nations to work together to safeguard their future. approved in 2010, the pacific oceanscape concept was introduced a year earlier by president anote tong of the republic of kiribati and designed with support from ci. and it’s not the first successful collaboration between the two; with partners including the new england aquarium, kiribati and ci worked together to create the phoenix islands protected area (pipa), a pristine ocean paradise rich in fish and coral that is both part of the pacific oceanscape and the largest marine protected area in the pacific. ci’s global conservation fund played a vital role in pipa’s creation, providing significant funding for both its development and ongoing management and technical assistance for its implementation. in 2010, pipa was recognized by unesco as a world heritage site—covering an ocean territory the size of california and some 6,000.
