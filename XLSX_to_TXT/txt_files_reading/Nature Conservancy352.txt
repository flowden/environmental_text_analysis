 north america’s grasslands are rare, life-sustaining ecosystems that house a great diversity of plants and animals. local partners such as the malpai borderlands group are essential to the conservancy's efforts to test innovative strategies and create the largest network of protected grasslands in the world: more than 63 million acres stretching across southern canada, the great plains and northern mexico. this comprehen- sive plan to protect north america’s most significant grasslands includes efforts to conserve several species of endemic birds that winter, migrate and breed within the great plains. elsewhere, the conservancy has also initiated programs in argentina and mongolia with the goal of conserving millions of acres of grasslands there.
