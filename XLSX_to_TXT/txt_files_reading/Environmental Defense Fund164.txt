 a half-century of limited development has meant that cuba’s coastal waters have escaped much of the devastation seen elsewhere in the caribbean. this could soon change. as havana opens the door to private enterprise and tourism, safeguards are critically needed. operating under a special license from the u.s. government, edf has been working with cuban scientists for 15 years. our efforts helped build and support an island-wide network of marine protected areas, including the gardens of the queen, a marine park that teems with large fish rarely encountered in the region. this success helped set the stage for a formal u.s.-cuba agreement in 2015 to collaborate on the science and management of marine protected areas. such joint scientific work is critical for the two countries, whose ecosystems are interconnected. sharks are particularly vulnerable. populations of some large sharks have fallen dramatically, perhaps by as much as 90% in the gulf of mexico. in 2015, edf helped the cuban government develop its national plan of action for sharks. the plan includes protection for juveniles, improved monitoring of threatened species and conservation areas where fishing for sharks is prohibited. to curb overfishing, the cuban government is also engaged in an initiative with edf called sos pesca aimed at combining fishing rights with catch limits and marine protected areas. this community-based project will equip local leaders with the tools to manage their own fisheries. “our goal is to build capacity to protect our shared resources,” says dan whittle, director of edf’s cuba program. edf and cuban scientists have identified possible nursery grounds for globally threatened whitetip sharks off cuba’s northwest coast.
