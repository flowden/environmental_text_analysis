 nfwf supports large-scale conservation efforts by organizations such as the nature conservancy and ducks unlimited, as well as those conducted by state natural resource agencies and native american tribes. investments made at this scale pay enormous dividends for a diversity of wildlife and bolster resilience for communities across the country. the new pecos watershed conservation initiative, a partnership with anadarko petroleum, chevron, noble energy, occidental petroleum, shell oil company, xto energy and usdaâ€™s natural resources conservation service, is one of many nfwf programs making investments at a landscape scale.
