 between one quarter and one half of the world’s swamps and marshes have already disappeared – because of land reclamation and drainage schemes, dams and barrages, or garbage disposal.but wetlands are not wastelands: they are highly productive ecosystems that support thousands of animal and plant species, yield food, fibre and building materials, filter pollution and provide clean water, and guard shorelines against the ravages of the sea. ● africa’s inland wetlands produce 1.5 million tonnes of fish annually and support one million fishermen. in asia, more than two billion people depend on wetland crops and fish as their main staple food and protein source. ● although wetlands cover about 700 to 800 million hectares of the earth’s surface, only some 50 million hectares (an area smaller than france) are well conserved. ● more than 200 of the world’s major rivers flow through more than one country but only a few agreements on joint management exist. ● one in six people in the world already lack access to safe drinking water – while almost half lack adequate sanitation. by 2025, two-thirds of the world’s population could be facing severe freshwater problems. proof that the growing world freshwater crisis had become everybody’s business came with the second world water forum in the hague in march 2000 – attended by governments, private sector companies, and ngos from more than 100 countries.wwf presented world leaders with specific recommen- dations for actions at local, national, and international levels – and opened the door for key future partnerships, including with the global environment facility, the world bank,and iucn – the world conservation union.
