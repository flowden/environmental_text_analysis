 over the past year, nrdc members and activists spoke out at public hearings in support of critical environmental policies on the federal chopping block, rallied with their communities to protect local lands and waters from exploitation by industry, and marched in the streets on behalf of climate justice. they shared nrdc’s calls to action through social media—platforms that now include more than two mil- lion followers—and helped us generate a whopping 18 million nrdc petition signatures and public comments since the election of donald trump. and through our 2018 get out the vote initiative, nrdc activists helped usher in the most diverse freshman class to the house of representatives our country has ever seen, as well as a whole new crop of climate champions into state legislatures and governors’ mansions.
