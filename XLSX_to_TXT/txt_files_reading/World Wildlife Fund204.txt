 river basins provide everything from food and water to energy and economic growth. but as we tap our vital freshwater resources in ever-greater amounts, how can we more effectively gauge a river ecosystem’s health and measure the impact of our actions? | in colombia’s orinoco river basin—a globally important system and critical habitat for endangered species—wwf is working with a host of partners to develop a new “report card” to transform how freshwater resources are being managed at the river basin scale. | by using a stakeholder-based, scientifically sound assessment of the river basin’s health, government officials, business leaders, and communities will be able to make informed decisions about how they use their freshwater ecosystems for energy, food, water, and economic growth.| to develop the report card, we are engaging local fishers, farmers, community leaders, academics, public officials, and others to ensure we understand and prioritize the issues most important to them. | once the process is tested, we will share it with stakeholders in other river basins around the world, so they too can create credible report cards; arm decision makers with clear, meaningful information to change behaviors and policies; and measurably improve river basin health. with our partners in colombia and from the university of maryland’s center for environmental science, wwf is gathering data about the orinoco river basin and will create a report card to help drive improvements in water policy, use, and management.
