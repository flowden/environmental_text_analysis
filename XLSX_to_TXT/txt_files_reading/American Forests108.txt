 to successfully advocate for protecting and enhancing tree cover, you first must know the value of the trees. american forests helps communities calculate the “ecosystem services” their forests provide in terms of cleaning the air and water, reducing temperatures, lessening erosion, and slowing stormwater runoff. american forests conducted urban ecosystem analyses (ueas), which assess the value of urban tree cover, in numerous cities in 2006: in gulf coast communities in mississippi, alabama, and louisiana; palm beach county, florida; flower mound, texas; the 14 counties that comprise the piedmont region of north and south carolina; montgomery, alabama; and ottawa, canada. an ambitious proposal to change the way society views the interaction of human and natural systems was outlined in the pages of american forests magazine. to deal with the growing problem of environmental degradation, it argued, we must find ways these “networks” can interact effectively. as the united states continues to develop, the goal is to create science and conservation methods that will restore ecological zones. the magazine will continue to discuss this proposal throughout 2007.
