 fort hood army base in texas is home to the largest population of golden-cheeked warblers. the base needed to conduct maneuvers, so edf created a habitat exchange, allowing the army to pay nearby ranchers to improve warbler habitat on their properties. once-skeptical landowners expanded habitat. the result? the known population of warblers nearly doubled from 5,000 to 9,000 birds. the cost? one-eighth of what easements would have cost.
