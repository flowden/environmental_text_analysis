 while our wildfire-related investments continue to grow in california, we also support similar efforts in many other areas of the country. decades of experience in vetting potential projects enable us to focus resources on the most cost-effective and successful techniques and on-the-ground implementers. examples include: in colorado, chaffee county will use a $366,000 grant to thin forests, reduce wildfire risk and improve wildlife habitat at the headwaters of the arkansas river. in oregon and washington, sustainable northwest will leverage a $349,000 grant to partner with tribes and forest collaboratives to reduce fuel loads across 430,000 acres and protect rural and indigenous communities threatened by intense wildfires. the nature conservancy will use a $275,000 grant to conduct controlled burns and other management practices across 50,000 acres of longleaf pine forest in georgia and florida, thereby reducing the likelihood and impact of catastrophic wildfire. in wyoming, a grant of $250,000 will support efforts by the wyoming game and fish department to restore habitat and improve connectivity in the thunder basin grasslands to benefit greater sage-grouse, pronghorn and rural communities. in hawaii, a grant of $80,000 will support efforts by the hawaii wildfire management organization to decrease sedimentation at coral reefs by reducing the risk of wildfire in the south kohala region.
