 in a region that has been significantly impacted by the bp oil disaster and recent catastrophic hurricanes, ocean conservancy is focused on advancing efforts that will heal the gulf and its iconic marine wildlife. our newest report, restoration without borders, is being used to identify areas in the region where endangered kempâ€™s ridley and loggerhead sea turtles are most at risk from pollution, fishing and shipping threats in order to identify optimal solutions for bringing these populations back from the brink. ocean conservancy has also focused on recovery and coastal resilience in the aftermath of the devastation wrought by the 2017 hurricane season in the gulf. we are working to ensure that restoration and recovery dollars are invested wisely to better protect gulf communities and marine wildlife from future threats.
