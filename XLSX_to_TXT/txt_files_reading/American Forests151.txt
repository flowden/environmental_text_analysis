 as more and more people congregate in urban areas, the idea of urban forestry has taken on increasing importance. afa’s urban forestry department has pioneered studies of city trees and their management. one afa study showed that, in a sample of america’s largest cities, an average of four trees were dying or being removed for every new tree planted. information like this helped galvanize national action in 1990, from local tree improvement projects to president bush’s america the beautiful initiative. one of the most exciting changes in urban forestry during 1990 was the development of educational material featuring a dew planting technique that research has demonstrated to be far more successful than the older methods. this technique, which involves preparing a larger, shallower area for the tree, will pay big dividends in the long run as fewer and fewer trees die of poor planting practices. in order to maximize the effectiveness of all the various government agencies and citizen's groups involved in the planting and care of community trees, the national urban forest council has been assisting with the formation of state urban forestry councils. these state councils, now numbering 38, are a critical factor in helping states and localities respond to the new federal program challenges created as a result of the expansion of the forest service's urban and community forestry program during 1990.
