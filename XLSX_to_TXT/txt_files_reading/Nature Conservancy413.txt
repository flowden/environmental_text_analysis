 here, on the eastern shore of the dominican republic, the river meets the sea. the rio yuna, beginning far away in the lush tangle of the cordillera central and its companion rio barracote, flows into the blue of samaná bay, making it one of the caribbean’s richest estuaries. humpback whales, endangered sea turtles, manatee and large populations of fish, oysters and shrimp rely on the bay—as do the people living here. fifteen thousand families depend on its bounty, but the waters no longer provide as they did once. overfishing of the bay, and diversion and damming of the yuna and barracote, have caused fish populations to plummet. the nature conservancy, with local partners and the government, is working to restore the estuary’s deli- cate mix of freshwater and marine ecosystems while helping local communities to meet their basic needs. through the development of a conservation area plan for samaná bay, the conservancy is helping to strike a balance between conservation and sustainable economic development.
