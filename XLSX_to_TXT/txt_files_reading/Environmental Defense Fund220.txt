 in china and india, edf is helping provide rural families with biodigesters that convert manure into biogas for cooking. this reduces methane emissions and improves the health of thousands of families by eliminating smoky indoor fires. in south india, edf scientists are training local technicians to gather field data on greenhouse gas emissions from crops. with our partners, we have set up five labs to analyze gas samples and measure the effectiveness of climate-friendly farming so that poor farmers can be rewarded in the voluntary carbon market. in a deal we brokered, india’s largest airline, indigo, allows travelers to partially offset their carbon footprint from flying by buying emissions reductions generated by our farmers. more than 500 million subsistence farmers can play an important role in reducing climate pollution. edf’s low-carbon farming and rural development projects have already reached 700,000 people in china, india and vietnam. the pilots use economic incentives to reward farmers when they adopt climate-friendly agricultural practices such as the precise application of fertilizer.
