 a jewel of biodiversity took an unprecedented step toward sustainability. last year, the government of west papua finalized legislation establishing it as indonesia’s first “conservation province.” this means that the local government is putting sustainable development and conservation at the forefront of any economic activity or development in the province. based on a first-of-its-kind legal framework, the legislation also protects some of the most intact and healthy marine and terrestrial ecosystems in the southeast asian archipelago, promotes the development of sustainable jobs and recognizes the rights of the region’s indigenous peoples. conservation international was instrumental in advising the provincial government on drafting and facilitating the issuance of the law. nearly the same size as new york state, west papua boasts 90 percent forest cover and is home to an area called the bird’s head seascape, widely regarded as the epicenter of marine life on earth, with more than 1,800 species of fish and fully three-fourths of the world’s hard coral species found in its waters. the announcement is a sweeping and unprecedented piece of legislation — and an effective blueprint for conservation international’s approach to protecting critical landscapes and seascapes.
