 conservation’s long-term success depends on the hearts and minds of local people. the health of wildlife and natural systems is intrinsically tied to the well-being of the people who share those landscapes, waterways and resources, whether in north america or africa or islands that dot the pacific. conservation cannot be done to, for or around local communities; it must emanate from their values and aspirations, and they must own its direction, challenges and achievements. the nature conservancy has long embraced the concept of community-based conservation, especially as the scope and scale of our work has grown around the world. that embrace means listening to diverse— and sometimes divergent—voices, finding common ground, building community coalitions and helping empower those marginalized by a globalized world. it means being a catalyst for conservation that enables communities to determine their own destinies.
