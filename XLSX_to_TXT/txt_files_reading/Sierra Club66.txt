 at the sierra club foundation, we believe our fiduciary duty includes a responsibility to manage assets in a manner that advances our mission and values. in 2010, the board of directors began shifting our investments to better meet environmental, social, and governance standards. we divested from fossil fuels investments, moved to a bank that is fossil fuel-free, and are increasingly investing in climate solutions. we were one of the initial signers of the divest-invest philanthropy initiative in 2014. in 2016, the signatories of divest-invest philanthropy received the 2016 nelson mandela-graça machel innovation award for brave philanthropy from civicus for our path-breaking commitment to divest from fossil fuels and invest in climate solutions. recognizing that this progress is not enough, the foundation is increasing its impact investing portfolio, defined by the global impact investment network as “investments made into companies, organizations, and funds with the intention to generate social and environmental impact alongside a financial return.” in 2017, the board of directors unanimously agreed that the foundation should continue to better align its investment portfolios with its mission, and engage in strategic impact investing. we seek investments that empower people and their communities with the resources, knowledge, and technologies needed to implement and scale clean energy and energy efficiency solutions. we are particularly interested in opportunities that benefit communities on the frontline of fossil fuel pollution and/or that align strongly with the sierra club’s community- oriented programs. we are excited to use our investments to increase equitable access to affordable clean energy, advance just economic transitions, ensure access to clean air and water, protect natural resources, and improve resiliency and adaptation to climate change.
