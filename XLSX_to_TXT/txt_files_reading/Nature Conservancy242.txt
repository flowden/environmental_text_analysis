 in the 1980s the conservancy helped develop an innovative, highly effective conservation tool: debt-for-nature swaps. some of the planet’s most biologically rich nations are also among the most indebted — so why not allow them to invest in conservation in return for reductions in their external debt? the conservancy fi rst tested this tool in 1987, arranging for fleet national bank of rhode island to donate $254,000 in costa rican debt titles to benefit the more than 100,000-acre braulio carrillo national park, an area of species-rich, rugged mountainous rainforests in the cordillera volcanica central biosphere reserve. during the last two decades, debt- for-nature swaps have become a vital tool in protecting tropical forests throughout latin america and the caribbean.
