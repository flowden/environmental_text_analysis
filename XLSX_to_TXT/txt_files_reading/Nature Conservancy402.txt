 at the dawn of the 21st century, the nature of conservation has changed and a new dialogue is emerging: conservation today is about conserving lands and waters for people, rather than protecting nature from people. the future of the human species, and all of earth’s other species, is dependent on a healthy planet and the life-sustaining systems that provide the clean air, water, food and shelter that both people and wildlife need to thrive.the mission of the nature conservancy is to preserve the plants, animals and natural communi - ties that represent the diversity of life on earth by protecting the lands and waters they need to survive. this mission speaks to the need for a global and local focus. the conservancy’s work is evolving, and its commitment to people and community is deepening. in the pages that follow, you will find first-person narratives by people whose lives are deeply intertwined with the natural world and who, in turn, are directly affected by local conser - vation efforts. their stories demonstrate the human relationship with nature and the role conservation plays in building hope for the future, sustaining ways of life and improving human well-being. these people are protecting places they care about, the places upon which they depend. they are protecting places for themselves, their communities and their children and for all of the species found there. in other words, nature for life.
