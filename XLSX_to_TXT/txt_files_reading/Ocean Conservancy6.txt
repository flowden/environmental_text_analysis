 the ocean is busy and getting busier all the time. as ocean ecosystems become more crowded and stressed, smart ocean planning helps to balance human activity with ocean health. ocean conservancy brought together industry leaders, fishermen and scientists from the northeast and mid-atlantic to improve science and data about the ocean while strengthening the region’s ocean plans. we hosted these leaders in washington, d.c., where they educated congressional offices and federal ocean agencies about the value of ocean planning. the strategy paid off when, for the first time, regional ocean-data portals received dedicated funding. this new funding supports regional ocean partnerships — organizations convened by governors that collaborate at a regional level with states, tribes and federal agencies to address ocean and coastal issues — improving their capacity to gather data on marine mammals, fisheries and climate that we need to conserve the ocean. we are also happy to report that the regional ocean partnership act advanced in in the u.s. senate. the bipartisan bill helps regional ocean partnerships conserve and restore ocean and coastal areas.
