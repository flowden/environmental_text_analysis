 a swath of protected deep-sea habitats off the west coast has doubled in size, thanks to a historic plan brokered by fishermen, edf and other nonprofit groups and approved by the pacific fishery management council. under the agreement, 140,000 square miles of ocean, an area larger than new mexico, has been safeguarded. simultaneously, 2,000 square miles of less sensitive habitat was reopened to fishing. the agreement was reached voluntarily, showing the power of aligning conservation incentives. “this was an amazing team effort,” says fisherman ralph brown of brookings, oregon. “both fishermen and environmentalists focused on the goal of opening up closed fishing grounds and carving out the areas that really need protection.” the resurgence of the pacific groundfish fishery made the breakthrough possible. that recovery has been attributed in part to secure fishing rights that edf helped implement in 2011. “this is now one of the best-managed fisheries in the world,” says shems jud, edf’s west coast fisheries director. fish populations are growing, and eight out of 10 species are fully recovered.
