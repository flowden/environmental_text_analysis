 on its southern peninsula and northern coast, haiti has established its first marine protected areas (mpas), encompassing a total of 402,881 acres, using conservancy assessments and mapping. conservancy scientists are now assisting the caribbean nation in managing its new mpas, employing drones (right) to help map and monitor the most important coastal sites. the conservancy is also training the staff of cuba’s national center for protected areas in such subjects as geographic information systems and satellite remote sensing to support the expansion of protected areas across cuba. cuba’s 1,000 square miles of coral reefs comprise nearly a quarter of all reefs in the insular caribbean. nature.org/ar-haiti
