 using an innovative water-banking model and a trust to acquire water rights, the nature conservancy joined with binational partners to ensure that the colorado river delta received dedicated water flows for the first time in nearly half a century. due to over-allocation of the colorado river for cities, agriculture and other uses in the united states and mexico, the river no longer reaches the gulf of california—harming fish and shrimp habitat—and has stopped regularly flowing through its delta, a critical habitat for resident and migratory bird species. the initial pulse release of water was a demonstration to show the potential for restoring the habitat supporting this rich natural diversity with potential benefi ts to surrounding communities. nature.org/ar-coloradoriver
