 on a summer 2010 expedition in the peruvian amazon, conservancy scientist paulo petry netted three specimens of an armored, wood- eating catfish that is new to science (but not to the indigenous people on the purus river). an august 2010 search for rare tree snails in hawaii by conservancy staff turned up instead clermontia peleana singuliflora, a flower last seen on the island in 1909 and long presumed extinct.
