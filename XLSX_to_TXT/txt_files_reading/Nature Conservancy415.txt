 for generations, the people of chileâ€™s valdivia region have looked to the rainforests along the southern coastline for sustenance. but decades of deforestation and neglect have decimated large areas, shrinking resources that the communities rely on for their livelihoods, food and medicine. in the spring of 2005, the nature conservancy and our partners inaugurated the new 150,000-acre valdivian coastal reserve. the conservancy and the world wildlife fund are working closely with neighboring fishing villages and indigenous communities to ensure that their traditional land uses remain part of the overall conservation strategy while promoting compatible local economic development.
