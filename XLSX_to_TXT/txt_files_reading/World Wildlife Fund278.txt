 in the coral triangle diving in the pristine waters of raja ampat brings us face to face with some of the most stunning sights in the world — fish in every color of the rainbow, dazzling gardens of hard and soft corals — surrounded by vertical islands covered in primary forests. the journey to reach this place took nearly 24 hours, and it was worth every minute to see nature in such a pure state. but there is trouble in these waters. after our dive, we talk frankly with local leaders. they ask us for help in taming the environmental footprint of the u.s. and china, and in responding to climate change, which is making oceans more acidic and sounding the death knell for corals worldwide. but whatever you do, they implore, don’t give up on traditional conservation like protected areas and mangrove restoration — because the healthiest reefs are the ones that will ultimately survive.
