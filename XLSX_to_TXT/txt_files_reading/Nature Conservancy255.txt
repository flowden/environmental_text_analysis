 the 1,000-acre follensby pond, where ralph waldo emerson and other 19th- century intellectuals once convened, is the jewel in a 14,600-acre acquisition by the conservancy in new york’s adirondack park. the property, purchased from the john and bird mccormick family, includes northern hardwood forest and 10 miles of meandering frontage on the raquette river. it borders the largest wilderness in the northeast and is also where bald eagles were first reintroduced to the park in the 1980s, following the species’ collapse in the 1960s.
