 declared a federal disaster in 2000, the pacific groundfish fishery—including species of sole, flounder and rockfish— is experiencing a remarkable recovery. nearly two dozen important species are now certified as sustainable, and fishing communities in california, oregon and washington are on the rebound. two popular species, bocaccio and darkblotched rockfish, achieved healthy population levels in 2017, years ahead of schedule. populations of these slowgrowing fish had been near collapse due to faulty management and overfishing. what happened? the national oceanic and atmospheric administration attributes the success to habitat protection and secure fishing rights, a new management system that edf helped implement in 2011. the result: fish stocks are the healthiest they’ve been in two decades, revenue is up and the amount of discarded fish has dropped by an amazing 80%. “twenty years ago, they wrote the obituary for this fishery,” says brad pettinger, president of the oregon trawl commission. “we demonstrated we can be good stewards of a public resource.” this west coast success is a testament to what’s possible. it’s also a model for other fisheries around the world.
