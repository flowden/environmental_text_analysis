 our roots run deep here at american forests. throughout our 144-year history, we have tackled global challenges with small actions done again and again: like planting trees. best of all, planting trees and caring for forests has a role for everyone, from cities to rural communities. with your help, american forests is empowering people to take action and make our country stronger together. but our work today is more urgent and complex than ever. thanks to our partners and donors, we’re tapping our deep roots in science, forestry, policy and movement leadership to overcome forest threats like drought and fire made worse by climate change. when we take care of our forests, they take care of us by providing water, wildlife, jobs and even the ability to slow climate change through natural carbon capture. but our challenges go beyond the environment. america has growing inequities across lines of race and income that include urban tree cover. i am proud that our new push for tree equity is building a movement to give every person the benefits of city trees for health, wealth and protection from climate change. with your help, we have stretched in new ways. we have published scientific breakthroughs on forest soil carbon and developed new ways to link underserved communities into urban forestry careers. we are stepping up to plant more trees and innovate climate-resilient planting techniques with new field staff around the country. our policy proposals are pushing federal and state officials to invest in our forests. because of you, our leadership is delivering results. from bringing back the endangered kirtland’s warbler with our releaf plantings in michigan to introducing new climate legislation that will plant billions of trees on our public lands, american forests is delivering change at scale. your support is deepening our roots and helping us reach for the sky. thank you for your support in 2019—and beyond!
