 david beckman is leading our efforts to ensure that the water we have is clean and that we use it as efficiently as we can. what’s new about nrdc’s approach to water? nrdc is devising and supporting policies that address the quality and availability of water at the same time. for example, green infrastructure strategies such as parks, porous pavement, and planted roofs reduce water pollution and also help capture stormwater where it falls. so we are helping to control the biggest source of water pollution—urban runoff—as we green our cities and limit the amount of water used for landscaping and other purposes. we also are now moving to advance integrated solutions in the agricultural sector, which currently accounts for 70 percent of america’s water use and releases large amounts of polluted runoff into our lakes and rivers. how are you leveraging nrdc’s assets to meet your goals? to improve water efficiency, we’re making use of some of the same techniques that nrdc has used successfully for years in the area of energy efficiency. we reached a very significant agreement last year with the largest trade association of appliance manufacturers in the country to increase the efficiency of clothes washers and dishwashers. by negotiating with a range of stakeholders that otherwise might have been our adversaries, we were able to make great progress.
