 people have always been crucial to our conservation mission. even if unspoken, we have always known that we, ourselves, are the ultimate beneficiaries of nature’s bounty and her continued health. today, as more of the world’s growing population migrates to urban centers and nature seems more distant, it is necessary to call attention to the many ways people—all people—depend on nature for our physical and spiritual well-being. many of us love nature for its own sake, and that is reason enough to safeguard the habitat of a blind cave salamander. but there are practical reasons for protecting nature, too. safeguarding the habitat of the blind cave salamander also protects the underground aquifer that provides people’s drinking water. protecting orangutans and the tropical forest they inhabit can also lower greenhouse gas emissions and help keep the atmosphere and sea levels stable. in the following pages, we demonstrate how nature matters to a range of people whose lives have been touched by work of the conservancy and our partners. nature feeds us, quenches our thirst, supports our health, creates clean air and provides the energy that powers our economy and the inspiration that feeds our souls. it’s not selfish to conserve nature for people; it’s simply a recognition that nature is part of us and we are part of it. your support of conservation and the nature conservancy is an investment in your own well- being and the nature that will matter to generations that follow.
