 in haiti, mangroves, beaches, lagoons and cays are essential for providing habitats for fish, sequestering carbon, buffering communities from the effects of storms and attracting tourists. unfortunately, many of these areas have been decimated by overfishing, pollution and unplanned development. cepf has supported local conservation leaders such as cepf grantee jean wiener, founder of fondation pour la protection de la biodiversité marine (foprobim), the only haitian-operated and haiti-based ngo dedicated to the protection and management of haiti’s coastal and marine ecosystems. with funding from cepf, wiener and foprobim have protected haiti’s delicate biodiversity, provided communities with new income opportunities and strengthened local organizations. wiener was one of six recipients of the 2015 goldman environmental prize, the world’s largest award for grassroots environmental activists, for leading “community efforts to establish haiti’s first marine protected areas by empowering haitians to see the long-term value in sustainably managing fisheries and mangrove forests.”
