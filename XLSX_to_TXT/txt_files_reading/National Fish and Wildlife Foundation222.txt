 our history as a private conservation nonprofit began when nfwf was chartered by congress in 1984. more than 35 years later, we continue to work closely with congressional leaders and staff to advance conservation throughout the nation. as part of our transparent grant-making process, we notify congress of all grants containing more than $10,000 in federal funding. though our organization often receives public funding from federal agencies, we also receive and manage funds approved by congress. in 2020, for example, we awarded $48.5 million through our emergency coastal resilience fund, which was launched in 2019 after congress passed an emergency supplemental appropriations bill to hasten recovery from hurricanes michael and florence, typhoon yutu, and the coastal wildfires of 2018. the grants awarded in 2020 leveraged nearly $70 million from grantees to generate a total conservation impact of more than $118 million. the projects we funded will use nature-based infrastructure such as living shorelines, wetlands and floodplain habitat to enhance the resilience of human communities while also improving wildlife habitats.
