 as the tundra buggy bumped over slushy ice fields searching for polar bears, a team—including wwf-us ceo carter roberts, wwf-canada polar bear and climate change specialist geoff york, bea perez of the coca-cola company, a film crew, and ryan seacrest—kept their eyes peeled. they wanted to see polar bears for themselves. the slush and unseasonably warm weather sent a clear signal: a late winter meant diminished sea ice and a truncated hunting season for the bears. the team on the tundra buggy shared a deep concern about this problem, and had come not only to search for polar bears but to get film footage. this would be used in support of arctic home—a campaign by wwf and coca-cola to educate the public about the plight of the polar bear, and to raise funds to protect a place in the high arctic that is key to the polar bear’s long-term survival. since its launch, arctic home—which rolled out across televisions, movie screens and coca-cola cans—has succeeded. public awareness of the plight of polar bears has leapt from 38 percent to 52 percent, and more than $1.8 million has been raised to protect polar bear habitat as the world’s sea ice shrinks.
