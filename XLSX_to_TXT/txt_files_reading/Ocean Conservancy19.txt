 with essential behind-the-scenes contributions from ocean conservancy, the u.s. chairship of the intergovernmental arctic council closed with a strong focus on conservation. we helped ensure the council’s ministerial declaration adopted a framework for an interconnected network of marine protected areas that could safeguard wildlife throughout the region. the declaration also tackled risks from increased arctic shipping, acknowledged the profound impacts of climate change in the pan-arctic and emphasized the need for global action to reduce greenhouse gases. finland is now advancing this robust conservation agenda under its 2017-2019 arctic council chairship. on the domestic front, ocean conservancy took the lead persuading the u.s. coast guard to adopt our recommendations for safeguarding the bering sea and bering strait from increased shipping. during the coming year, we will work toward implementation of these measures — protecting the area for the millions of marine mammals that pass through it each year and for its local indigenous and coastal communities.
