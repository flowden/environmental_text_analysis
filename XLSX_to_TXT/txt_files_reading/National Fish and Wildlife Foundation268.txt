 on mexico’s beaches, the most desired visitors are the oldest, biggest females—at least as far as hawksbill and green sea turtles are concerned. these matrons lay the most eggs and are therefore a key to increasing turtle reproduction. safeguarding beaches is the secret. human poachers, raccoons, and dogs, among others, take a toll on adult female turtles, their eggs, and the hatchlings. keep these predators at bay, and the turtles grow older and bigger and lay more eggs. six times in the last decade, nfwf has provided funds to pronatura península de yucatán to help them put “more eyes on the beaches.” by funding nightly patrols along the nesting beaches each summer, pronatura helps enforce a 1990 ban prohibiting the harvest of adult turtles and their eggs. the results are encouraging. the number of older females nesting is increasing and egg production is up. although it will be many years before the offspring of these green sea turtles return to their natal beaches to nest themselves, confirming that these conservation efforts are indeed working.
