 spring on the northern great plains brings sun, melting snow, rain and migrations—a seasonal cycle of rebirth. but the deep snows of last winter forced many of montana’s pronghorn south of the ice-covered missouri river in numbers few had seen before. in april and may, wwf biologist dennis jorgensen documented their return trip. that trip marked the conclusion of a study conducted over three years: wwf has tracked 102 gps-collared pronghorn to determine how they navigate an increasingly fragmented landscape. we now know that some pronghorn travel more than 400 miles annually, and that extreme winters drive them toward danger zones like railroad tracks, highways and a maze of fences—and across rivers they are ill-prepared to swim. the results of this study are being used to communicate the challenges pronghorns face in the northern great plains, and to develop solutions that pave the way for a prairie economy that makes wild migrations as pivotal as cattle or oil.
