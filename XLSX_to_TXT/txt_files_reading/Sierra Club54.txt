 meaningful collaborations bring us together to move beyond a dirty fossil fuel-based economy and toward a sustainable, healthy future. the climate change crisis deepens social inequalities and can only be addressed in conjunction with other societal injustices. we are learning to become true partners in building a just and sustainable world. our success in 2017 was rooted in strong relationships with community groups, local officials, native american tribes, social justice organizations, and others. by increasingly centering our support in community-based organizing, non-traditional partnerships, grassroots action, and power- building, we are partnering for progress.
