 to this end, conservation international is creating scientific tools and financing methods that are already revolutionizing conservation. by sharing our discoveries with the world, we are making an impact far beyond what we can do on our own. the past year saw the launch of groundbreaking science-based tools that conservation international helped develop: trends.earth: tracking land change this free, open-source online platform is helping countries evaluate the status of their soil and make the best decisions for their land â€” and for the people who depend on it. funded through our longtime vital signs program, which monitors agriculture and the environment in africa, trends.earth gathers and analyzes data from multiple sources to detect changes in land cover. the platform is already being used by the united nations to monitor and combat land degradation and desertification around the world. trase: exposing supply chains this free, open-source online platform uses publicly available sources such as export and tax records to trace the supply chain of major agricultural crops including palm oil, soy and beef back to companies and countries. by making the invisible visible, trase can reveal the deforestation footprint of unsustainable agriculture. the european union is using trase to reduce demand for commodities associated with deforestation.
