 in florida, and increasingly across the country, one of the national fish and wildlife foundation’s greatest challenges is deciding how to spend the limited and precious financial resources entrusted to us by donors to provide the greatest return for wildlife. determining the relative value of habitats or ecosystems is no easy job, but it’s exactly what the wildlife and habitat keystone was created to do. the outcome for florida in 2007 was impressive. using a $1,075,000 grant through the acres for america partnership with wal-mart, turner foundation, and others, nfwf helped conserve the 13,000 acre yellow river ravines property in the panhandle. this land acquisition, executed by the nature conservancy, did more than just protect habitat for red-cockaded woodpeckers, gopher tortoises, and a host of other threatened wildlife. it helped connect more than 800,000 acres of habitat stretching across the panhandle into alabama. think florida, and most folks envision white, sandy beaches, citrus groves, disney, and lots and lots of people. florida’s balmy climate and myriad attractions have made it a prime destination for millions of vacationers and new residents. the development needed to support this growth has squeezed the state’s diverse wildlife and challenged conservationists to grab what pricey real estate they can before the natural habitats are long gone. the yellow river ravines wasn’t just any real estate purchase—it’s a landscape link with value extending far beyond its property lines. chosen from more than 100 investment requests submitted to us from across the country, this acquisition provided a return on investment we believe exceeded every other option. how can nfwf work to replicate this success on a day by day basis in everything we do?
