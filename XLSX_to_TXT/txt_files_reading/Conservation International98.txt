 if nature could speak, what would it tell us? this question was the inspiration for conservation international’s “nature is speaking” series of short films, each told by a part of nature. the films are voiced by acclaimed actors, including ci’s vice chair, harrison ford, as “the ocean.” launched in october 2014, “nature is speaking” has generated over two billion impressions and 48 million video views. the united nations invited conservation international to screen the films at the paris climate talks in december 2015 to ensure that nature’s voice was heard and could help influence the outcomes of the historic climate agreement. people are joining us in listening to nature — and taking action. “nature is speaking” films have been quoted by heads of state and tweeted by oprah winfrey. most important, the campaign has inspired tens of millions of people around the world with the message that nature doesn’t need people — people need nature.
