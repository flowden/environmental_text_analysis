 in october 2019, pope francis held a gathering at the vatican to discuss the amazon. at the meeting, called a synod, the pope urged the more than 180 cardinals, bishops, priests and indigenous leaders in attendance to stop the destruction of nature and to protect the world’s most important rainforest before it passes a “tipping point” that will see it shift irrevocably into dry savanna. conservation international has embarked on an innovative and unconventional partnership with the catholic church to save the amazon and support indigenous peoples. the overwhelming majority of the region’s inhabitants identify as catholic. together with partners, we supported outreach discussions and materials, roundtables and listening sessions that fed into the synod, as well as a meeting of amazonian governors at the vatican to discuss their critical role in conservation efforts in the region. the pope has made his vision clear for protecting the amazon and the people who call it home. we will join a global network of partners to support that vision, and to build upon his convening power to earn the political and financial commitments of governments, the private sector and other actors needed to make it happen.
