 how are the climate crisis and the extinction crisis related? how do we jointly tackle the two greatest threats to our living planet? one could say that we wrote the book. a new book edited by renowned scientists lee hannah of conservation international and thomas lovejoy, a member of conservation international’s leadership council, presents research and observations by dozens of global experts on the intersection between wildlife and the climate — and describes the actions we must take to stop a complete climate breakdown. “biodiversity and climate change: transforming the biosphere” — published last year as a sequel to a seminal work released in 2005 by the same authors — is already being used as a teaching text in universities, where it will provide an invaluable foundation for the next generation of scientists and decision-makers.
