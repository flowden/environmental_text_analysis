 coral reefs are among the worldâ€™s most valuable ecosystems in terms of ecological, economic and cultural capital. however, recent reports indicate that up to 70 percent of coral reefs, globally, are directly impacted by human-associated activities. in fiscal year 2016, nfwf awarded $1.1 million in grants to organizations working to reverse the impacts of land-based pollution, overfishing and other factors to improve the health of coral reefs in the united states, its territories and beyond.
