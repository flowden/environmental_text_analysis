 there are solutions and they begin with communities. throughout our history, ci has worked with indigenous peoples and local communities around the world. our most successful collaborations begin at the planning table, with all parties accurately informed of their roles, rights and anticipated benefits throughout the process. in fy07, our partner communities proved once again that their stewardship and knowledge is crucial to conservation success. the wai wai indigenous group in guyana, with support from ci, developed and adopted a conservation management plan for its homeland of more than 6,000 square kilometers of pristine rain forest. by establishing the first legally recognized community owned conservation area in guyana, the wai wai are safeguarding their culture and valuable resources while creating new economic opportunities for future generations. in the democratic republic of congo, a new generation of local conservationists is leading efforts to save traditional lands and threatened gorillas. in fy07, the tayna center for conservation biology awarded degrees to its first graduates, who have since returned to their homes to work as rangers and protected area managers. ci’s global conservation fund supported the university’s creation and has made it our highest funding priority in africa. ci-suriname and the trio people of south suriname, together with the inter-american development bank and the government of suriname, launched the iwaana samu ecotourism program and lodge, the first eco-lodge in the region. many other communities we work with have similar stories of dedication and success in conserving and managing the ecosystems that are a critical contributor to human well-being, demonstrating that local people are the best natural stewards of their surroundings.
