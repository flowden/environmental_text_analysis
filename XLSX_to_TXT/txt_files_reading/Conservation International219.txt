 a team of researchers, including conservation international climate expert bronson griscom, created a global map to help answer these questions, using artificial intelligence to determine how much — and how quickly — forests could absorb and store carbon from the atmosphere if humans simply left them alone. the results, published in the journal nature, found that tropical forests can regrow up to 32 percent faster — and capture significantly more carbon from the atmosphere — than was previously estimated. these findings represent a quantum leap in our understanding of humanity has cleared nearly half of the world’s forests. but what would happen if we let many of these lands return back to forests? and how much climate-warming carbon would they absorb? the potential of forest restoration, underscoring the need for more restoration projects while identifying the specific places where conservation international and its partners in reforestation can be most effective over the next 30 years.
