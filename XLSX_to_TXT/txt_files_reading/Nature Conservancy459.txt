 no organization better understands the value of a lasting impression than the nature conservancy. for more than 50 years, we have worked to achieve enduring results that demonstrate our steadfast commitment to preserving and protecting earth’s last great places, in all their diversity. through this report, we introduce just a few conservancy supporters who—moved by the sweep of a prairie, a swath of tundra, or the discovery of a real-life shangri-la— are carrying this commitment into action. inspired by places they will always remember, they have found a way to leave lasting impressions of their own. these advocates are shaping the future by ensuring that it includes the very places that engaged them in conservation. their stories demonstrate the power of partnership, the strength of science and the lasting impressions we can leave by preserving earth’s wonders for future generations.
