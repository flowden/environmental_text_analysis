 over the past year, a new wave of women leaders drove efforts to prevent and adapt to the impacts of climate breakdown. in late 2018, joênia wapichana, a member of conservation international’s indigenous advisory group, won the prestigious united nations prize in the field of human rights. conservation international nominated wapichana, the first indigenous lawyer in brazil and the first indigenous woman elected to brazil’s legislature, in recognition of her fearless work to defend the rights of indigenous peoples. and in 2019, hindou oumarou ibrahim, conservation international’s senior indigenous fellow, was awarded the pritzker emerging environmental genius award for her tireless work advocating for indigenous peoples in the fight to solve the climate crisis. in summer 2019, conservation international partnered with the world’s largest fashion magazine to celebrate women leading the fight against climate change. elle magazine dedicated its july issue to women in conservation — from indigenous leaders and politicians to scientists and activists — including three women from conservation international: president jen morris, vice president dr. emily pidgeon and vice president shyla raghav. the issue — featuring cover stars gisele bündchen, doutzen kroes, naomi campbell and anja rubik — was unveiled by our ceo, m. sanjayan, and elle editor-in-chief, nina garcia, at conservation international’s los angeles gala. the issue and event marked the first in a series of efforts between elle and conservation international to call attention to climate change.
