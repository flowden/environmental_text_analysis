 thanks to sugar production certification standards supported by wwf, many popular products— from soda to chocolate—will now contain sugar that was grown, harvested and processed to meet industry-best sustainability standards for the environment and human rights. raizen sugar company, the largest sugarcane company in the world, helped confirm the viability of the movement to sustainability when it received certification on 130,000 tons of sugar and 63 million liters of ethanol. this first batch of certified products was sold to other wwf partners, including unilever, braskem and the coca-cola company. this is good news for freshwater and marine ecosystems around the world such as the mesoamerican and great barrier reefs, which are threatened by runoff from unsustainable sugarcane production. “it took less than one year for certified sugar to take off,” says kevin ogorzalek, wwf’s manager for agricultural commodities and field programs. “we’ve gone from zero to 2 percent of global production area, with sustainable producers in two of the largest sugarcane producing countries. and producers from around the world are signing up to get involved all the time.”
