 on the first day of international climate discussions in cancun, mexico, 18 of the world’s largest brands— including the coca-cola company, johnson & johnson, procter & gamble and unilever—pledged to help achieve zero net deforestation by 2020. as members of the consumer goods forum (cgf), these companies have committed both individually and through collective partnerships to help save tropical forests worldwide. this new commitment will have a profound impact by reinforcing the power of global markets to conserve the species and places wwf seeks to protect. “the scale, reach and purchasing power of these companies could help put an end to tropical deforestation in countries like brazil and indonesia,” said jason clay, wwf’s senior vice president of market transformation. wwf is supporting the pledge by helping cgf companies address the leading drivers of deforestation— palm oil, soy, beef, paper and timber—and focus on responsibly sourcing these building blocks of consumer products used throughout the world.
