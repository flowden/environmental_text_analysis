 nrdc’s groundbreaking work with statehouses around the nation gives the lie to naysayers in washington who have yet to realize that economic and environmental prosperity go hand in hand. at the state level, the clean energy future is already becoming a reality. our energy team has been working with utilities and state officials for decades, securing scores of efficiency and renewable energy policies, and ushering the next generation of clean energy technologies into the marketplace. we’ve also tapped our on-the-ground presence to pioneer models for cutting carbon, such as the regional greenhouse gas initiative, a program we helped design that is reducing carbon emissions from power plants and driving investment in energy efficiency in 10 northeastern states. rggi has saved consumers $900 million on their energy bills and allowed the states to cut carbon pollution by 30 percent. in california, clean energy policies have created the largest bright spot in the state’s economy. by showcasing the real jobs and public health benefits that shifting to clean energy has delivered, we helped defeat a ballot measure heavily funded by oil companies. nrdc tapped our partners in california’s business, clean tech, and public health communities to show that fighting global warming is good for the state’s economy. voters agreed and overwhelmingly voted to uphold california’s groundbreaking climate law in november.
