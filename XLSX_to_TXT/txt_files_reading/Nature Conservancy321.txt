 micronesia, a tiny string of islands in the western pacific, is leading the world in coral reef and island conservation efforts. the micronesia challenge—launched in 2006—is an ambitious commitment by five micronesian governments to “effectively conserve at least 30 percent of the near-shore marine resources and 20 percent of the terrestrial resources across micronesia by 2020.” the conservancy is helping the islands reach these goals in a number of ways. along with a start-up pledge of $3 million, the conservancy is assisting partners with identifying the most biodiverse places, establishing protected area networks, developing management plans, and training local organizations how to best protect priority areas.
