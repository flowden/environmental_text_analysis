 in one of the biggest david vs. goliath stories to date, we turned initial small investments in a midwest legal strategy into 200 coal-fighting staff and tens of thousands of volunteers, stopping planned coal expansion in its tracks (183 plants never built, and counting). forward-thinking philanthropists joined us, putting close to $30 million on the line to force a multi-billion dollar coal industry into retirement (200 plants gone, and counting). that momentum pushed us to the gates of the white house, and to the streets of detroit and new orleans, building a public call for clean energy solutions. in california—where we secured a commitment from los angeles mayor eric garcetti to build the largest urban rooftop solar program in the nation—we heard news resonate all the way to paris, as the state joined other un countries in committing to only zero-emission vehicles by 2050. the sierra club has been working in coalition with environmental groups and native communities in alaska and america’s arctic for more than three decades. during that time, with the ultimate goal of protecting the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife refuge (a critical calving ground for the porcupine caribou herd) as a national monument, we’ve funded key efforts to prevent oil drilling in sensitive areas and stop oil and coal company roads to nowhere. thanks to the work of the club and its allies—bringing inuit representatives to washington, dc, to have their voices heard and organizing local communities and national interests to build a groundswell of support—president obama showed conviction in 2015 and set the stage for landscape-sized monuments and further efforts to keep fossil fuels in the ground in his final year in office. this is long-range, capacity-building, grassroots organizing at its best, and a clear example of how investments in this strategy pay off.
