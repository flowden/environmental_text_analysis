 the political stars are aligning along the pacific flyway, paving the way for significant conservation gains. in california, for instance, we’ve been instrumental in creating the country’s largest network of marine reserves— a boon for audubon priority birds like marbled murrelets and black oyster - catchers as well as for fish and marine mammals. now oregon and washington are beginning to follow suit. on land, audubon california is partnering with other nonprofits and government agencies to help farmers and ranchers adopt more bird-friendly practices. putting working lands to work for birds makes farmers, the government, and audubon happy. paying rice and alfalfa farmers to delay their harvest, for instance, benefits migrating long-billed curlews and breeding tricolored blackbirds. although alaska is part of the pacific flyway, it could be considered the mother of all flyways, because billions of birds breed there. that’s why the government’s preliminary decision this year, promoted by audubon, to safeguard nearly half of the 23-million-acre national petroleum reserve-alaska was so important. protecting an area five times the size of yellowstone is unparalleled.
