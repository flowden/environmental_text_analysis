 it seems only a few weeks ago that i stood at the edge of a great plain, looking out across a vast sweep of savanna in brazil’s little-known cerrado region. i was there to visit conservancy staff, partners and local landowners who are banding together to conserve this unique but threatened ecosystem, and to discuss how to ensure that surrounding agricultural lands can be managed compatibly with natural landscapes. i could not help but reflect on the fact that all of us, from very different backgrounds, were moved by a deep connection to land and a sense of place. there is something about dedicating oneself to conservation, whether as vocation or avocation, that pulls deeply on a wellspring of personal commitment to those things that give life its most profound meanings. throughout my career as a conservationist, i have been fortunate to stand in many places that have left such lasting impressions. in the profiles that follow, you will meet fellow conservationists from varied backgrounds with commitments that take many forms, manifesting themselves in prairies and forests, in streams and bays, in mountains and plains and agricultural lands. some are close to home; some, very far away. but they all share two common themes: transformation of a personal belief into action and a dedication to preserving the diversity of life on earth. this report is but a snapshot of one brief period of time. you’ll see numbers that record the 2002 fiscal year. and you’ll sample many of the projects that came to fruition in that fiscal year and in the months that followed, because the work that we do cannot be broken down into the neat metrics of a calendar. in its totality, however, a picture emerges of an organization that is vibrant, engaged in an increasingly wide range of venues and extraordinarily focused on pragmatic approaches to achieve indelible conservation results.
