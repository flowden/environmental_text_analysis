 edf climate corps pairs business school students—the green business leaders of tomorrow—with companies and public institutions looking to reduce energy waste. this summer, edf trained 97 fellows to work at at&t, caterpillar, facebook and elsewhere. since the program began in 2008, our fellows have found $1.2 billion in energy savings, enough to power 150,000 homes.
