 at the turn of the 20th century, nearly 100,000 attwater’s prairie-chickens roamed six million acres of prairie habitat along coastal east texas and louisiana. today, only six dozen chickens remain in a shrinking habitat of 200,000 acres. without intervention, this imperiled bird likely faces extinction. while efforts to raise more birds through artificial propagation are ongoing, few chicks survive when released into the wild. as part of nfwf’s attwater’s prairie-chicken initiative, researchers are determining why chicks fail to thrive and are looking for ways to minimize their vulnerability to predators, disease, and poor nutrition. nfwf also plans to partner with private landowners to create more abundant natural habitat for this endangered species. nfwf grants are already having a measurable impact. through the conocophillips spirit of conservation program, a grant to the houston zoo has increased the number of chicks that are hatched for release into the wild by 30% annually. another grant to the nature conservancy of texas helps private landowners in the attwater’s range restore prairie habitat, creating potential new release sites.
