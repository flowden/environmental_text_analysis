 ocean conservancy engaged a wide range of influential stakeholders, including industry leaders and scientists, to improve ocean data in the northeast and mid-atlantic regional ocean plans. as ocean ecosystems become more crowded and stressed, data-driven ocean planning is needed to improve coordination between agencies and resolve ocean-use conflicts. we hosted many of these stakeholders in washington, d.c., where they educated congressional offices and key federal ocean agencies about the merits of ocean planning. this strategy paid dividends when the trump administration preserved key principles of ocean planning after revoking president obama’s national ocean policy with their own. our work to educate federal agencies on the value of ocean planning most recently manifested in the u.s. coast guard’s maritime commerce strategic outlook, which outlines the agency’s national vision and made ocean planning a direct policy priority. together with our partners, we are ensuring that ocean planning succeeds over the long term, resulting in sustainable management of our ocean and blue economy.
