 the nature conservancy raised a record amount of private funding in fiscal year 2016, enabling 7 percent growth in operations and continued investment in capital project work around the globe. total revenue was muted, however, by negative investment returns for the year, at minus 1.84 percent, and lower than normal conservation land gifts and sales. as a result, total net assets as of june 30, 2016, were $5.9 billion, slightly below the balance of the prior fiscal year end. programmatic efficiency (69.9 percent) was somewhat below the prior fiscal year (71.2 percent) because of lower conservation/ land purchase opportunities, and because the conservancy made needed investments in upgrading core information systems and growing its membership. the financial results depicted here are derived from the conservancy’s audited june 30, 2016, consolidated financial statements, which contain an unqualified audit opinion. the conservancy’s complete, audited financial statements can be obtained online at nature.org/annualreport or by calling (800) 628-6860.
