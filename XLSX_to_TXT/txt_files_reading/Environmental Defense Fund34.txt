 if cargo ships were a country, they’d be the sixth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases. the international maritime organization agreed in 2018 to cut global shipping emissions in half by 2050, and this year a coalition of shipping companies, organizations and countries pledged to operate zeroemissions ships along deep-sea routes by 2030. the new pledge was heavily influenced by edf’s sailing on solar report. since 90% of global trade moves by ship, slashing emissions on the high seas will help put the world’s freight on a low-carbon path.
