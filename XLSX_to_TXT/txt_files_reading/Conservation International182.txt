 for more than 15 years, conservation international has worked with local communities to protect the waters of the bird’s head seascape in indonesia. this region is widely regarded as the epicenter of marine biodiversity in the world. since then, we have helped to establish and improve management of some 40,000 square kilometers (25,000 square miles) of marine protected areas (mpas) that are co-managed by communities and government for conservation and sustainable fisheries. we know that protected areas need long-term sustainable financing for monitoring, enforcement and management — and we are taking the next step through our blue-halo initiative. this innovative initiative allows limited commercial fishing in the waters that surround — and that benefit from — marine protected areas. in return for the ecological services provided by the mpas, the fishing companies invest in conservation management to sustain the mpas. this concept would provide a flow of sustainable financing into mpa management, linked to the spillover of fish stocks from the protected area into surrounding fishing concessions. in the long run, this effort will create environmentally sustainable fisheries, create local employment and boost government revenue.
