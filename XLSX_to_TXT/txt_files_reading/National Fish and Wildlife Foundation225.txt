 in 2020, we continued to work with the u.s. department of agricultureâ€™s natural resources conservation service (nrcs) to provide farmers, ranchers, foresters and other private landowners the tools they need to become better stewards of their working lands (more on p. 43). working closely with nrcs, we manage competitive grant programs that support conservation technical assistance, outreach and education on farms and ranches, which in turn generates benefits to wildlife, water quality and soil health.
