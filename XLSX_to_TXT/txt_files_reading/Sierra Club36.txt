 when people think of the sierra club foundation, what usually comes to mind is our funding of grassroots efforts to protect treasured wildlands and move the planet beyond fossil fuels. but there’s another important facet of our strategy to protect the planet—our investments. while the sierra club and its partners are shutting down coal-fired power plants or sharing the healing power of nature, we’re teaming up with scores of allied investors to identify and advance renewables and other technologies to bring critical climate solutions to scale. at the same time, we’re committed to making sure the next energy economy is as inclusive as possible—more fair than the one it replaces, so that all people benefit, not just a few industries or individuals. it means good local jobs and affordable clean energy. it also means air and water that are safe and healthy, no matter what your zip code is. both our grantmaking approach as well as our social and environmental justice screens of potential investments support these values.
