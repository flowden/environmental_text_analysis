 to address the worst ivory poaching crisis in history—and the collateral damage to entire ecosystems and local people—the nature conservancy has ramped up existing elephant conservation efforts into an african elephant initiative. the initiative aims to increase security forces on the ground (above) and to reduce demand by leveraging the conservancy’s powerful board of trustees in china. a new report proves that poaching rates are lower in community-led conservancies, which the conservancy is helping to create. in addition, the conservancy is providing market-based incentives for wildlife conservation and, in china, board members signed an anti-ivory pledge to erode the prestige of ivory collecting and to mobilize other top private-sector leaders and cultural influencers. nature.org/ar-saveelephants
