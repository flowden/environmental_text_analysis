 conservation international is working to flip the script by valuing the carbon that trees remove from the atmosphere and store. through carbon projects, we can help to protect the climate by protecting forests — and the people who depend on them. as one part of the solution to climate breakdown, forest-carbon projects are helping humanity bend the climate curve. in the past year, conservation international had success behind the scenes, working with the civil aviation industry to pave the way for airlines to help neutralize their climate footprint through carbon offsets. now, we’re heading from the skies back down to earth: building on the successes of forest- carbon projects in peru and kenya — which have generated millions of tons of carbon-emissions reductions along with countless environmental and community benefits — we are looking to develop a carbon project in cambodia aimed at attracting investors for long-term financing. through these projects, we are demonstrating that these “natural climate solutions” are immediate and effective tools to bend the climate curve. tropical forests are our greatest natural ally in the fight against climate change, yet in many places they are more valuable dead than alive.
