 in 2016, conservation international announced a new partnership with arizona state university (asu) to bring together scientists from both institutions to address the pressing challenges of sustainable development: protecting nature while promoting economic growth. this partnership, the first of its kind between a large public american university and a u.s.-based international conservation nonprofit, is bearing fruit. six conservation international scientists co-taught the first “conservation in practice” course to 38 undergrad and graduate students and will offer the course again in spring 2019. in addition, asu students worked on trends.earth, helping to create a visual interface that makes it easier for policymakers to make smart decisions about land health.
