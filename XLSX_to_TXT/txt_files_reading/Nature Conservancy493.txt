 along montanaâ€™s rocky mountain front, where the great plains meet the mountains, the blackfeet indians were the original stewards of the land. now, the nature conservancy is working with the blackfeet indian land conservation trust corporation to help the tribe regain more of its traditional lands and protect vital grizzly bear habitat. the land trust, which the conservancy helped organ- ize, has made its first land purchase: the 1,140-acre flat iron creek ranch. the ranch will be managed to conserve wildlife habitat and will serve as an education center to promote conservation along the front.
