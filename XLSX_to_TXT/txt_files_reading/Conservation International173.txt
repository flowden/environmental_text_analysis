 some of the world’s most important ecosystems — and most threatened — are in the clouds. “cloud forests” are high-altitude tropical rainforests that are regularly shrouded in cloud cover. they’re extremely rare, making up only 1 percent of global woodland. and not only are they home to an extravagance of unique wildlife, they filter and store water that provides renewable energy for millions of people around the world. but cloud forests are quickly being lost to urban sprawl and unsustainable agriculture. enter the cloud forest blue energy mechanism, an initiative launched last year and developed in part by conservation international. the innovative effort aims to mobilize commercial finance to reforest and protect cloud forests that benefit the hydropower industry through an innovative “pay for success” technique — the first of its kind in this context. in short, the investments that hydropower plants downstream make in upstream cloud forests reduce sedimentation, increase water flow and improve water regulation, which results in tangible benefits to their companies. the new investment tool is already being used in latin america, which has lost about half of its original cloud forest. enabling energy security while protecting clean water, forests, wildlife, the climate — all while powering local economies? it doesn’t get better than that.
