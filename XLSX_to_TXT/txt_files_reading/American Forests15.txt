 as american cities have grown and become more densely populated, american forests has advocated for more equitable distribution of urban trees and greenspaces so they can benefit everyone. from tree canopy analysis and strategic tree planting to mitigating heat island effect and reducing the dangers caused by storms and flooding, our urban forestry work prioritizes underserved neighborhoods and people. a new aspect of our equity focus in cities in 2018 was urban forestry workforce development. american forests is advancing efforts to grow long-term tree care jobs for the underemployed. working with tree nursery partners in detroit and an urban wood reclamation and reuse start-up in baltimore, american forests is piloting projects that are the foundation for future expansion of urban forest-related workforce training programs. american forests continues to strategically plant trees based on data and science. in houston, damaging flooding and excessive stormwater run-off are inextricably linked to lack of sufficient tree canopy cover. our restoration work there this past year has been in direct response to hurricane harvey. miami-dade county also faced tree canopy loss in multiple hurricanes last year and continues to be one the fastest-warming metropolitan areas in the u.s. the trees we plant in miami-dade not only replace lost canopy but also reduce ground-level temperatures and absorb storm surges. of greatest concern to american forests is the well-being of vulnerable people who have few options in merciless heat waves or extreme weather. these are the communities that we prioritize, and this focus determines where we invest in restoring tree canopy that grows in value and impact.
