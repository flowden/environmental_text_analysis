 for many people, the world’s best-loved animals and the threats they face provide the inspiration needed to fight for their conservation. wwf is using this energy and commitment to ensure that, by the end of the current decade, the numbers of elephants, rhinos, tigers, pandas, great apes, sea turtles, and whales are either stable or increasing and that their habitats are safeguarded. successful conservation of “flagship” species like these benefits the thousands of lesser-known plants and animals – as well as human communities – with which they coexist. at the same time, wwf is fighting to stop the illegal trade in some of the world’s most endangered species, such as snow leopard, tibetan antelope, and big-leaf mahogany – one of the world’s most valuable and sought-after trees. nobody doubts the road ahead is uphill but the organization can already point to some successes. for example, populations of the two african species of rhinos are slowly growing. intensive conservation efforts have helped the black rhino to increase from an estimated 2,704 in 1999 to 3,100 in 2001. in the same period, the number of white wwf is fighting to stop illegal trade in the seriously endangered snow leopard. rhinos rose from 10,405 to some 11,600. these are encouraging trends but there is still much to be done. to ensure a future for threatened plants and animals, wwf works in two spheres. it engages with local communities and organizations in practical conservation, such as the creation of protected areas or reintroduction of rare species. and in the wider world, wwf works to influence government decisions affecting international treaties such as the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora (cites). with the help of many partners and supporters, wwf’s species programme is making a difference where it counts – on the ground.
