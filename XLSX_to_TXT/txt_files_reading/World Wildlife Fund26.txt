 pollution from toxic chemicals is found in every ocean, every continent, even the air we breathe. ● many of the 80,000 man-made chemicals currently in use are biologically reactive and environmentally persistent – yet virtually none has been tested adequately. ● chemicals that are toxic by design – such as insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides – are released into the environment in truly staggering amounts: up to 2.7 million tonnes a year. ● endocrine disrupting chemicals interfere with hormonal activity within the body. any chemical that interferes with hormones can scramble vital messages, derail development, and undermine health. endocrine disruptors are threatening many species, from albatrosses to whales… and humans. wwf’s global toxic chemicals initiative is working to phase out and ban the most deadly, persistent pollutants that endanger every species, ecosystem,and community on earth.its two major targets are to cease the deliberate production, release, transfer, and use of 16 priority persistent organic pollutants (pops), and to phase out nine priority substances known to have endocrine-disrupting effects.
