 protecting our northern seas for arctic people and wildlife the arctic continues warming faster than anywhere else on the planet. thus, in 2020, we sustained our initiatives to maintain ecosystem resilience: ● continued our fight against oil and gas development in the arctic — and the u.s. arctic ocean remained closed to oil and gas drilling. ● advanced next-generation shipping measures to protect the arctic. our report on the at-sea transfer of oil catalyzed a set of standardized best practices that will help prevent oil spills. our primer on e-navigation explained how new and emerging communications and navigational technologies, which transmit data in real time, can help protect the marine environment and advance safety in the arctic’s remote and dangerous waters. ● furthered climate-ready fisheries management in the bering sea, maintained key habitat protections and precautionary commercial fisheries closures in the u.s. arctic, and worked to ensure the central arctic ocean fisheries agreement is implemented.
