 throughout the north american west, an intense demand for water — for agriculture and other human uses — jeopardizes the health of our rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands. nfwf’s western water program works cooperatively with farmers, irrigation districts, indian tribes and other partners to acquire and transfer established water rights from willing sellers. these and a host of related efforts improve critical flows and water-dependent habitats for at-risk fish and wildlife. the columbia basin water transactions program, established by nfwf and the bonneville power administration in 2002, has restored significant flows to dozens of rivers and streams across the pacific northwest, and more recently has inspired similar efforts in the walker river basin in nevada and california, the rio grande in southern new mexico, and the colorado river delta in mexico.
