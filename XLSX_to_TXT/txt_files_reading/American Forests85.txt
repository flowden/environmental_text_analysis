 healthy forests need healthy markets, and our efforts to increase the use of wood in green building achieved significant gains in 2011. at aff’s year of the forest celebration in march 2011, secretary of agriculture tom vilsack made a ground-breaking announcement that the u.s. department of agriculture would officially recognize wood as a good, “green” building material, declaring a preference for wood in all new usda buildings and announcing a new initiative to promote wood. secretary vilsack’s leadership helps position atfs-certified wood products in the marketplace, and paves the way for other federal agencies to adopt similar green building policies. in a related legislative development, aff, working in concert with many partners, succeeded in getting language added to legislation in 2011 that will require the u.s. department of defense to review its green building policies, which could open the door to increased use of wood in defense department buildings. the green building market in the united states is estimated to balloon from $7.1 billion in 2010 to $173 billion by 2015. wood is “the” green building material and aff will continue to ensure that wood, especially atfs certified wood, is included in this growing market.
