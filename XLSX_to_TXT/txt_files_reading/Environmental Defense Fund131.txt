 years of drought in the west are bringing a flawed water system to the breaking point. but the crisis has created an opportunity to improve the way water is managed. edf is developing a series of pilot projects in some of the hardest hit regions. after california passed a law in 2014 to safeguard groundwater, we began working with allies in the san joaquin valley, where many wells have gone dry. we’re providing leadership training to managers of small water districts to restore safe drinking water to parts of the central valley. we’re also working with state agencies to promote water sharing that encourages conservation and sends water to where it’s most needed. meanwhile, another critical western water source, the colorado river, is seriously overallocated. facing mandated cuts in water usage, california, arizona and nevada are negotiating voluntary reductions in their share of water from the colorado. seizing this opportunity, edf is creating a water exchange program in arizona, which gets 40% of its water from the river, that will enable the state to manage a reduced supply.
