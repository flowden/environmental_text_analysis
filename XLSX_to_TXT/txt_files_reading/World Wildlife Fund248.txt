 the mekong is the longest river in southeast asia and a lifeline for 60 million people. but 11 dams are proposed for the river’s lower mainstream, and its future in laos, thailand, cambodia and vietnam is at a turning point. as part of a multifaceted effort, wwf and our partners are providing scientific support, socioeconomic and ecological data, and technical expertise to the mekong river commission, an intergovernmental agency which includes representatives from the four lower mekong countries. wwf’s dekila chungyalpa testified before a senate subcommittee about threats to the lower mekong, helping to secure u.s. support for sustainable decision making in the region. and a wwf- commissioned review of the proposed xayaburi dam in northern laos revealed that it could obstruct the migration of more than 50 species of commercially important fish and compromise millions of livelihoods. on april 10, 2011, the joint committee of the commission deferred the decision on xayaburi until later ministerial-level meetings. in december, the commission agreed to delay a final decision pending deeper environmental and technical studies of the dam’s potential transboundary impact.
