 in collaboration with the nature conservancy and others, operators of china’s three gorges dam—the world’s largest and one of its most controversial dams—began to alter the amount of water flowing through the giant structure. the release of large amounts of water is intended to mimic the yangtze’s flood pulse, which promotes carp spawning, and marks the fourth straight year that dam operators modified water releases to better mimic natural cycles. carp occupy an exalted position in the culture and cuisine of china, and carp numbers had declined rapidly following operation of the dam—affecting protein sources and livelihoods for people living downstream. with the construction of hydropower dams on the rise in china, the conservancy is working with the chinese government, major hydropower companies and nonprofi t organizations to develop sustainable alternatives to the design and operation of dams planned for the yangtze. nature.org/ar-carp
