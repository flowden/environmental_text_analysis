 ocean conservancy believes that we can have both a healthy ocean and strong seafood businesses, but we are taking too many fish from the sea and many species are in woeful shape because of it. to promote our sustainable fishing work, ocean conservancy launched a new online platform called “from fishery to fork” (www. oceanconservancy.org/fisherytofork) that tracks the major steps in the progression of wild- caught seafood from the ocean to the consumer. the site highlights the opportunities for fishery managers, policy makers, fishermen, retailers, consumers and others to improve sustainability throughout the industry. on a policy front, emboldened by the profound victory that we and our partners secured with the alaska fishery management plan for the arctic (see page 4), ocean conservancy was a key advocate for a decision in florida to apply federal grouper management standards in that important ocean state’s waters. also in the gulf of mexico, a scientific assessment of red snapper showed that conservation measures were working—measures put forward by ocean conservancy years ago—helping to end overfishing of red snapper. it was a positive development, but much work remains before this important fishery is declared fully rebuilt. we can have both a healthy ocean and strong seafood businesses.
