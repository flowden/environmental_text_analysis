 the nrdc action fund—a sister organization of nrdc —has fought successfully for years to build support for pro- environment legislation through paid advertising, phone-banking and grassroots mobilization. in the summer of 2010, after its clean energy allies in congress came under fierce attack for supporting a comprehensive climate bill, the action fund set out to bring the advocacy power of its most influential supporters to the table. through the adams project, named for board member (and nrdc founder) john adams, the action fund keeps this network of high-profile environmental ambassadors up to date on congressional intelligence and strategy decisions, helps them connect and build relationships with elected officials, and lets them know how they can help advance and defend key pro- environment legislation. in 2011, when tea party leaders in congress proposed a suite of bills aimed at undermining bedrock protections for our air and water, the action fund quickly mobilized its adams project ambassadors to meet face-to-face with senators and members of the media with whom they have relationships. in april, due in large part to this strategic effort, the senate voted down four amendments that would have curbed crucial clean air protections. later in the year, as the leading environmental grasstops network in the country, the adams project helped shore up the necessary political will to secure tougher vehicle fuel efficiency and pollution standards, derail anti- environment appropriations measures in congress, and stop the keystone xl tar sands pipeline. moving forward, project members will continue to fan out from coast to coast to build support for action fund priorities in key political hubs and help engage new high-profile ambassadors, particularly in the midwest.
