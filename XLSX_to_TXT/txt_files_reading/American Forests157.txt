 afa generated major policy initiatives related to the goals of global releaf. we worked with congress in developing several significant bills for urban and community forests, rural forests, and tropical forests. these bills respond to a wide array of environmental concerns and call for increased research, expanded education and technical assistance, and new incentives to encourage more tree planting and better forest management. the legislative issues and initiatives in which afa was most active during the last session of the 101st congress include: urban and community forestry--h.r. 2144; s. 1399; s. 1610, private nonindustrial forestry--s. 970; s. 1063, global climate change--s. 324; h.r. 1078; s. 1610, national forest management oid growth, new forestry, tropical forestry--h.r 2065; s. 1610, air quality--president bush’s clean-air proposals, water quality and quantity—water quality 2000 initiatives. toward the end of the year, we began assisting the administration with the development of a new tree-planting and forest improvement initiative--the america the beautiful program. we also began working with the leadership of the senate and house agriculture committees in developing a new state and private “forestry tide’’ for the 1990 farm bill. key objectives are to improve the stewardship of private forest lands, and to protect them from development threats.
