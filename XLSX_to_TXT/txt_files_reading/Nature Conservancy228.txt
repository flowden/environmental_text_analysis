 at the invitation of the chinese government, the conservancy took its first step into this increasingly important country in 1998. in the himalayan foothills of the yunnan province, four of asia’s great rivers come together and flow within a span of just 56 miles, winding their way through high mountains and narrow canyons and valleys, creating unique microclimates and supporting an abundance of wildlife. the yangtze, irrawaddy, salween and mekong rivers supply approximately one in 10 people on earth with food, water. while the yunnan great rivers project’s focus began in the forested habitats between the rivers, a more concentrated effort downstream on the yangtze has evolved. demonstration sites are being developed for some of river conservation’s most cutting-edge strategies to mesh nature conservation with people’s food, energy and transportation needs in this rapidly developing nation.
