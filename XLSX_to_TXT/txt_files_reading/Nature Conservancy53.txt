 for the third consecutive year, the nature conservancy raised a record amount of private funding. that, together with returns from our investment portfolio of 9.0 percent, allowed us to grow spending on operations by 5.9 percent and further invest in our capital project work around the globe. from a balance sheet perspective, our strong operating results, combined with the significant increase in conservation land gifts, resulted in an increase in our total net assets as of june 30, 2018, to $6.6 billion which represents a 6.05 percent increase from the prior year. programmatic efficiency (74.2 percent) was significantly higher than the prior fiscal year (66.8 percent) due to a major increase in conservation land purchase activity. this increase, though, highlights the cyclical nature of the conservation land business, and we expect to see continued fluctuation in this metric in future years. the financial results depicted here are derived from tnc's audited june 30, 2018, consolidated financial statements, which contain an unqualified opinion. the conservancyâ€™s completed, audited financial statements can be obtained online at nature.org/annual report or by calling (800) 628-6860.
