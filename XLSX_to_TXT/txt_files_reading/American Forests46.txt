 and while we are proud of our accomplishments, we are ever more focused on our mission and aiming even higher in our goals for the year ahead. the urgency to protect and restore forests has never been greater. in the last decade alone, the world has lost hundreds of millions of acres of forests, and here in the u.s., millions of acres are being lost each year to wildfires and other natural disasters, disease and insects and nearly constant development pressures. here is just a sample of the work we are doing to stem the tide — and the work we plan to do in the coming year: american forests planted its 45 millionth tree, funding a total of 900 projects since 1990 and planting more than 2 million trees this year in 20 states and 14 countries. we have now funded forest restoration projects in a total of 44 countries and in all 50 states. through our endangered western forests initiative, we planted more than 17,000 whitebark pine trees in the greater yellowstone ecosystem, and with the application of pheromone patches, protected more than 4,000 critical cone-bearing trees from beetle infestation. work continued on restoring wildlife habitats in places such as: the lower rio grande in texas for the endangered ocelot and jaguarondi (33,350 trees); michigan, for the threatened kirtland’s warbler (two projects, with a total of 93,000 trees); minnesota, for the osprey and bald eagle (600,000 trees); florida for the threatened gopher tortoise (429,000 trees); mexico, for migratory birds (40,000 trees); and indonesia, for the endangered orangutan (35,460 trees). we restored areas damaged or destroyed by wildfires in arkansas (61,200 trees); california (75,000 trees); florida (429,000 trees); new mexico (45,000 trees); montana (two projects — 186,300 trees); and texas (54,252 trees).
