 wwf celebrated its 40th anniversary in september 2001. founded in 1961 by a number of influential, far-sighted individuals concerned about the deteriorating state of the environment, wwf has grown over the intervening four decades to become one of the world’s largest and most respected independent science-based conservation organizations. wwf’s mission has broadened over the years to address the full spectrum of the world’s biological diversity and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature. the organization looks for new and sustainable ways of using the planet’s natural resources and tackles the many forms of pollution that are harming the atmosphere, fresh water, and oceans which ultimately sustain life. despite the organization’s strength and its ability to adapt and grow in an increasingly complex world, the challenges that lie ahead are more daunting than ever. in these pages we reflect on some of the successes of the distant and recent past, and the bold targets we have set ourselves. to achieve its objectives, both in the short and long term, wwf recognizes the need for partnerships – with governments, business and industry, non-governmental and other civil society organizations, and, crucially, individual people in all walks of life. this, too, is reflected in these pages. if ever there was a time for wwf and its partners to pull together, that time is now.
