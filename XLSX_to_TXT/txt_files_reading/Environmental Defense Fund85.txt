 in the heat of the 2016 campaign, donald trump vowed to dismantle the environmental protection agency (epa), leaving behind only “little tidbits.” once in office, he appointed an extreme foe of the environment, oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt, as head of epa. pruitt quickly began trying to roll back public health safeguards. in response, edf deployed two powerful weapons: our millions of supporters and our political partner, edf action. edf action works with both parties to defend critical environmental protections at the federal and state levels. unlike edf itself, edf action can engage in extensive lobbying, giving us more political muscle to take on well-funded opponents. the administration’s attack on core environmental values triggered a historic response. edf membership surged past two million, our moms clean air force affiliate is now an additional one million strong, and our outreach to millennials, latinos and conservatives has gained momentum. these voices are helping us fight back—and laying the groundwork for renewed political power. edf action has won important victories. in a dramatic senate vote in may 2017, we preserved national limits on methane leaks from oil and gas operations on public lands, protecting the climate from this powerful greenhouse gas. we and our allies also prevailed in a house vote on an amendment that would have barred the defense department from preparing for climate change— something the pentagon calls a “threat multiplier.” edf action had only 12 hours’ notice that the vote was coming, but we succeeded in assembling a coalition that included 46 moderate republican supporters.
