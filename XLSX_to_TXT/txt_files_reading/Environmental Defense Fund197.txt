 the toxic substances control act (tsca) makes it so difficult to prove harm from a chemical that, since tsca was passed in 1976, companies have only had to test about 3% of the 85,000 chemicals available for commercial use. in 2014, the need to reform this federal law was vividly demonstrated when a chemical spill near charleston, wv, left 300,000 people without drinking water. public officials could find virtually no hazard data on the spilled chemical, despite the fact that the coal industry has used it for years. edf scientist dr. richard denison linked the problem to outdated regulations and questioned the governmentâ€™s assurances of safety given to charleston residents. in washington, he advised legislators in making hundreds of improvements to proposed tsca reform legislation. meanwhile, epa issued its first final risk assessments under tsca in 28 years, finding that two commonplace chemicals pose unacceptably high risks to workers and the public. edf is pushing the agency to institute safety measures for the chemicals.
