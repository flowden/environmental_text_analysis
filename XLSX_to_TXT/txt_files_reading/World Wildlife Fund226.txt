 off the north coast of mozambique, brightly colored buoys mark no-take fishing zones in the primeiras and segundas seascape. during a recent fish survey, wwf project manager john guernier noted that biodiversity inside the sanctuaries is increasing and compliance with no-take regulation is high. with a grin, a local fisherman replied, “the only ones not complying are the dolphins.” unseen in the area for more than a decade, a pod of 14 bottlenose dolphins has returned to feed in the local moma estuary. the availability of fish for them to eat is evidence of the results being achieved in mozambique’s first “area of environmental protection.” established in 2012, the coastal marine reserve covers over 4,020 square miles, including sandy islands, coastal mangroves, estuaries, dry forests and farmland. some of the poorest fishing communities in africa live within this biologically rich area. since 2008, wwf and care have collaborated to develop marine sanctuaries and conservation farming, working with coastal households that rely on the area’s natural resources for survival. today the primeiras and segundas initiative is beginning to realize community-based natural resource management on a scale never before achieved there.
