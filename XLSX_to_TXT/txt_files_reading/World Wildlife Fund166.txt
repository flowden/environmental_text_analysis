 when wildfires burned through the amazon and australia, wwf mobilized emergency funds from a diverse group of new and existing donors to support people and wildlife. wwf-us raised nearly $2 million to support partners and local communities on the front lines in brazil and boliviaâ€”enough to provide firefighting equipment, food, water, medical supplies, training to monitor ongoing fires, and radios. in australia, in addition to the human toll, an estimated 3 billion animals died in the blazes. a portion of the $6.8 million wwf raised was funneled to local wildlife rescue organizations to recover and rehabilitate species like koalas and sugar gliders.
