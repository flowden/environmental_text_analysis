 the northern everglades is a 3.5-million -acre landscape of cattle ranches, longleaf pine savannas and seasonal wetlands that form a critical conservation resource. for decades, the conservancy has helped protect hundreds of thousands of acres and identified appropriate northern everglades properties for natural resources conservation service programs under the farm bill, assisted ranchers with participation and provided testimony to washington decision-makers. in a major victory for nature, the u.s. department of agriculture dedicated $89 million for permanent conservation easements on 26,000 acres in the fisheating creek watershed at the headwaters of the everglades ecosystem, the largest easement project in the programâ€™s history.
