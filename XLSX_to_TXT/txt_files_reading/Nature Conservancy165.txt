 to supply and encourage consumer demand for sustainably caught fish, the nature conservancy implemented a traceability pilot project with artisanal fishing unions in southern chile to determine the exact location, amount and weight of fish and shellfish they catch. the retailer and consumer may then access the data through a qr code that directs them to a website with the confi rming information. in indonesia, the conservancy is working with two seafood companies with global reach to enhance their seafood traceability and collect data on the condition of fish stocks in order to adapt practices to sustainable levels. nature.org/ar-sustainablefi sh
