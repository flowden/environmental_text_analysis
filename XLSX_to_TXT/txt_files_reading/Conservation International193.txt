 conservation international fought for two massive wins in the policy arena. in january 2019, u.s. president donald trump signed into law the tropical forest conservation act, a reauthorization of a landmark conservation law that lapsed in 2014. for months prior, conservation international painstakingly engaged with u.s. lawmakers to get the bill passed and put before the president. the act uses debt-fornature swaps, which enable countries to trade their debt to the u.s. for funds to protect nature in their own country — an idea that conservation international pioneered. the act has already saved more than 27.5 million hectares (68 million acres) of tropical forest, the equivalent of taking about 12 million cars off the road for one year. and in september 2019, the state of california approved the tropical forest standard — a blueprint for allowing tropical forest protection initiatives to be included in the state’s cap-and-trade system. the standard sets a powerful example for recognizing the role of forest protection in solving the climate crisis. conservation international made this possible, drafting rules and protections that ensure that carbon finance programs are effective, lasting and designed collaboratively with indigenous peoples and local communities to ensure respect for traditional rights and knowledge.
