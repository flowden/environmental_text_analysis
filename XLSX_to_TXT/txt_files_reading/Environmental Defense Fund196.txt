 with the need for chemical safety reform growing increasingly urgent, edf turned to the world’s largest retailer to help place safer products on america’s shelves. in 2014, walmart rolled out a policy developed with edf the previous year to phase out potentially harmful ingredients from tens of thousands of products— shampoos, body lotions, cosmetics and more—in its u.s. stores, which serve 140 million customers weekly. most chemicals have never been tested for possible health impacts, even as research shows that babies in the womb typically carry dozens of toxic chemicals and pollutants in their bodies. no wonder consumers are demanding change. walmart used a software program we helped develop to assess chemicals in formulated products. the results were disturbing: nearly 40% of walmart’s assessed products contained chemicals that may pose health risks. walmart asked edf to help create a policy for its suppliers to replace these chemicals. with chemists and toxicologists, we prioritized chemicals according to their hazard, prevalence in products and potential for human exposure. walmart then targeted a short list of chemicals of concern to remove from its products. under the policy, walmart suppliers must show that newly added chemicals are safer than those they replace. suppliers also must disclose all ingredients in their products by 2015. “everybody must be transparent by january 1,” says michelle harvey, edf’s supply chain director. “if not, they’re threatening a very important business relationship.” with walmart’s unparalleled purchasing power, its policy will inevitably drive change throughout the $250 billion global personal care and household products industry. we’re already seeing ripple effects: target and cvs have announced their own chemicals programs this year. “these actions show that what’s good for people and the environment is also good for business,” says edf vp of corporate partnerships tom murray.
