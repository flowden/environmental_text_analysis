 this project protected 1,120 acres of extraordinary wildlife habitat along squaw creek, a tributary of the deschutes river in central oregon. a conservation easement on a private ranch will permanently conserve the property’s valuable habitat and its importance as a link to 189,000 acres of adjacent protected lands. it will also provide for the ranch’s continued operation. the easement is part of the deschutes basin land trust’s back to home waters program–a landscape-scale conservation effort that supports the reintroduction of salmon and steelhead in its traditional range.
