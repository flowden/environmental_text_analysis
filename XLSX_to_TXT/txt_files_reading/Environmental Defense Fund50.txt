 on a farm in romney, indiana, a monarch butterfly alights on a flower, taking a short pause on its epic 3,000-mile migration. restoring monarch habitat is one of many conservation measures brent bible has taken on his 5,000-acre corn and soybean farm, where native grasses and wildlife-rich wetlands flourish amid fields of cover crops and unplowed land. as the climate changes and global food demand grows, farmers like bible increasingly share edf’s vision of farming in balance with the natural world — harnessing technology to support diverse species, improve soil health, reduce nitrogen pollution from fertilizer and improve the land’s ability to withstand floods and droughts. in pursuit of these goals, edf has forged new partnerships with tyson foods, the biggest u.s. meat producer, and the national corn growers association, which represents more than 300,000 farmers. so far, these and other partnerships have delivered improved fertilizer management and soil health on more than 5 million acres. “edf was the first environmental group to reach out to farmers and listen to our perspectives,” says nebraska farmer brandon hunnicutt.
