 five years ago, the nature conservancy and caterpillar inc. came together with a shared vision of people working together to maintain and restore healthy, sustainable rivers for the benefit of natural and human communities around the world. this vision became the great rivers partnership, which brings together scientists and resource managers on the mississippi river, china’s yangtze river, south america’s paraguay-paraná rivers and other great rivers to advance conservation by sharing strategies, scientific research and lessons learned. these rivers are the heart of their nations’ history, culture and economy. they provide food, water and livelihoods for hundreds of millions of people and create critical habitat for thousands of species of plants and animals. by strategically bringing the right people together, the great rivers partnership is facilitating the sharing of knowledge and expertise to accelerate the conservation of the mighty waterways that sustain us all.
