 this year the conservancy adopted an ambitious and transforming 10-year conservation goal that will drive us to work at a more global scale and in every variety of landscape. wherever we work, we will pur- sue strategies tailored to three main types of habitat: terrestrial, freshwater and marine. in all of these places, the conservancy looks for opportunities yangtze river basin, china solomon islands great bear rainforest, canada upper mississippi river katahdin forest, maine caribbean basin pantanal, brazil valdivian coastal range, chile to share science-based strategies, tools and lessons learned across diverse landscapes. the map on these pages illustrates a few examples of places where the conservancy is working in similar habitats to protect, restore and preserve lands and waters around the world. for instance, the conservancyâ€™s experience from working in coniferous forests in northern maine is helping to inform its conservation strategy in other coniferous forests. the knowledge gained from developing an ecoregional plan for the caribbean basin is guiding ecoregional planning in other areas. and, lessons learned from restoring and managing large floodplain rivers in brazil, china and the united states will help shape plans for other large floodplain river basins.
