 mangroves provide an estimated $82 billion in flood risk-prevention annually for coastal communities and store up to 10 times more carbon per hectare than terrestrial forests — yet nearly half of the world’s mangrove forests have been lost in the last 50 years. to drive more financing to the conservation and restoration of mangroves, conservation international is tapping into insurance markets to monetize the trees’ value to flood reduction and climate mitigation. in a pioneering approach to coastal property insurance, the restoration insurance service company (risco) for coastal risk reduction will engage with insurance companies to incorporate the value of mangroves into insurance products. the companies will pay an annual fee and carbon credits will be sold, with both revenue streams financing mangrove restoration and conservation. a planned pilot in the philippines will conserve and restore 4,000 hectares (9,884 acres) mangroves. over 10 years, the project will provide a climate benefit of more than 600,000 tons avoided and sequestered carbon emissions. risco could eventually generate more than $200 million for mangrove protection, avoiding emissions equivalent to the annual electricity use of more than 2 million homes.
