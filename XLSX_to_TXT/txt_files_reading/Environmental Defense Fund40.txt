 one of karin tuxen-bettman’s earliest memories is of a world map on a wall in her childhood home. studded with pushpins representing previous and future travels, the map inspired a lifelong passion. “maps enable us to lay our own stories over a global canvas,” she says. “they reflect our connection to the world.” today, tuxen-bettman works at google earth outreach, helping nonprofits use google mapping tools. a key partner in edf’s mission to map pollution around the world, she led the project to install air quality sensors on google street view cars. “we’re making air quality data local and visible so decisionmakers can zero in on sources of pollution and take action,” says tuxen-bettman, who holds a ph.d. in environmental science. to date, edf and google have mapped natural gas leaks in 13 u.s. cities and analyzed blockby- block air pollution in london, houston and oakland, california. a project in salt lake city is just beginning. the results can drive pollution-reducing measures at the city, state and federal level. “karin is a change-maker,” says millie chu baird, associate vp in edf’s office of the chief scientist. “the combination of street view cars, low-cost sensors and advanced data analysis is fueling clean air action around the globe.”
