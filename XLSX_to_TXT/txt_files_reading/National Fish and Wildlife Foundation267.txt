 nfwf strives to achieve the best possible outcomes for marine and coastal conservation by focusing funds where they are most critically needed. we will work diligently with our partners and grantees to measure the outcomes of our investments in trying to achieve the overall objective for marine and coastal conservation. specific outcomes include: increasing the size and quality of marine protected areas; changing the population status of select marine species; reducing habitat degradation and species loss from identified priority human impacts; measuring the reductions in key stressors of estuarine systems (e.g. sediment and nutrient levels in the chesapeake bay) that can be associated with our investments; and assessing the relative effectiveness of capacity building and education/outreach strategies
