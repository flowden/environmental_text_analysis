 in 1996, the conservancy helped launch one the world’s first large-scale projects to reduce carbon emissions created from deforestation, the second leading contributor of carbon emissions worldwide. with bolivian partner organization fundación amigos de la naturaleza (fan), we created the 30-year noel kempff mercado climate action project, which aims to reduce carbon emissions by protecting 1.5 million acres of tropical forest that were threatened by deforestation. together with the bolivian government and three energy companies, the partners terminated logging rights in areas adjacent to an existing national park and incorporated these lands into the park, creating the 3.9-million-acre noel kempff mercado national park. the project has also created park ranger positions and other jobs that provide an alternative to logging. through the avoidance of deforestation the project is expected to prevent the release of up to 5.8 million tons of carbon dioxide over a total of 30 years. in 2005, noel kempff became the fi rst reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation, or redd, project to have its carbon reduction benefi ts independently verified by a third party, demonstrating that forest carbon projects are an important part of an overall solution to climate change. by protecting forests, the noel kempff project simultaneously addresses climate change, conserves biodiversity and brings sustainable benefi ts to local communities.
