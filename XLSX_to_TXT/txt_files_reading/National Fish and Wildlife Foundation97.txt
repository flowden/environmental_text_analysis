 as the nation’s largest conservation funder, the national fish and wildlife foundation supports projects across the united states and abroad to sustain, restore and enhance our nation’s fish, wildlife and natural resources. for more than three decades, nfwf has advanced this mission with the support of our many partners, including federal and state agencies, corporations, foundations and individual donors. the foundation focuses on using the best available science to deliver measurable, long-term results. each day, nfwf works to protect and restore imperiled species, promote healthy oceans and estuaries, improve working landscapes for wildlife, advance sustainable fisheries and conserve water for wildlife and people. in the following pages, we share a few examples of our work from 2014.
