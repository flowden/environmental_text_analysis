 wwf is committed to delivering on the promise of the paris agreement to slow climate change. to do that, we’ve helped unite a host of unlikely partners to drive climate action. through the science-based targets initiative, wwf is helping more than 488 companies— and counting—set ambitious carbon-cutting goals. through the renewable energy buyers alliance, we’re helping hundreds of businesses buy more renewable energy and fight for cleaner electricity grids. and through coalitions like we are still in, we’re uniting politically powerful voices—business, universities, and local government—to uphold the paris agreement. we’re also tackling land stewardship. land use generates 24% of greenhouse gas pollution and drives forest loss, habitat destruction, and waste. improving land use patterns could produce up to 30% of the climate solutions needed by 2030. so as part of the 2018 global climate action summit coalition, wwf is calling on companies, states, and local leaders to cut waste, reduce excess consumption, improve the efficiency of food systems, and work together toward more sustainable production in landscapes around the world.
