 what a year! the pandemic, punctuated by brutal injustice and a heated election, dominated 2020. it was good to see the calendar turn to 2021. even with all this, ocean conservancy was there for the ocean; we did not waiver. and you were there for ocean conservancy — from petitions to decision-makers, cleanup efforts through the virtual international coastal cleanup and, of course, financial support. these actions made our year amazingly successful, despite the challenges we faced. as the chair of the board of directors, i’m proud to say that ocean conservancy hardly missed a beat. working from home around the country, our staff still accomplished so much. in our cover story, you’ll read about our robust ocean agenda in anticipation of the new administration. we’re heartened to see climate change, the single greatest threat to our planet, emerge as a top priority with the new administration. we’ll hold their feet to the fire, along with congress, to do what’s best to support our ocean on all fronts. and in the center section, you’ll find many accomplishments — from efforts at home and abroad to mitigate climate change and reduce plastic pollution to improvements in fisheries management challenged by a warming ocean, to advancements in shipping measures in the arctic’s thawing waters, to the launch of our “shores forward” initiative in florida to protect from rising sea levels due to climate change. you’ll read of these successes and more amidst a challenging year. now, in 2021, ocean conservancy is more committed than ever to bold and ambitious ocean conservation. we cannot do it without you! our board of directors, our ceo janis searles jones and all of ocean conservancy thank you for your support in 2020 and ask you to stand with us again in 2021.
