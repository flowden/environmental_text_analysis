 last summer, a team of rour nrdc staffers set out on a fuel-free road trip through the midwest in an electric chevy bolt, stopping in nine cities in five states, from michigan to missouri. along the way, the crew-samuel garcia, ada statler, patricia valderrama, and madhur boloor, all schneider fellows in the climate & clean energy program-visited manufacturing and research and development facilities, spoke to a wide variety of electric vehicle (ev) stakeholders, and got a firsthand look at the ways in which electric cars are a part of the midwest's economy, culture, and history. (in fact, the country's first electric car, unveiled in 1890. was built by an iowan. the group blogged about their adventures, writing, "after 10 days in our ev, we were not only impressed by the driving experience and all the ev champions we met along the way but also by the curiosity and interest that folks had about our ear and our road trip. strangers would come up to us while we were charging and ask us questions about what we were driving, how far it could go, or how long it would take to charge."' the trip also served as a reminder that electrification is revving up nationwide as nrdc helps push forward state and city level programs for ev adoption.
