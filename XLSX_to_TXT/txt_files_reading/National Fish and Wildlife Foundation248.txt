 in selecting keystone initiatives, nfwf has to determine the impact of our investment relative to those of our partners—what we call “the nfwf effect.” investment timing, contributions of other donors, partner capacity, and sustainability costs are variables that push the nfwf effect up or down. by analyzing quantitative and qualitative variables, we’re able to set priorities and measure the effect we have within the mix of other contributors. the nfwf effect provides a baseline to measure the effectiveness of our strategies and actions. and it will help guide us in achieving future success.
