 the skagit river delta in western washington state is rich in wildlife. it is a critical stop on the pacific flyway for migratory shorebirds and waterfowl and crucial habitat for recovering salmon populations. but the delta also boasts a family-farming heritage. this three-year study, supported by the conservancy and a coalition of university, government and agricultural association partners, seeks to discover how habitat rotation can be compatible with crop rotation with implications for similar estuary systems around the world. part of the hypothesis is that farmers who rotate their land through three-year cycles of controlled flooding that accommodates migratory shorebirds increase their yields and cut their costs by eliminating the need for pesticides and chemical fertilizer.
