 in a pioneering move, and after pressure and encouragement from nrdc, president obama used the power the 1906 antiquities act to protect some of today's important wild places and historic sites. the president started by declaring the san gabriel mountains a national monument in october 2014 and then gave that designation to six other special areas in 2015: the pullman district in chicago, colorado's browns canyon. hawaii's honolulu internment camp, berryessa snow mountain in california, nevada's basin and range region, and the waco mammoth fossil bed in texas.
