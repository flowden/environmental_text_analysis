 meanwhile, in the carolinas, several stakeholders have reclaimed 206 miles of fragile native dune and loggerhead sea turtle nesting habitat through the help of one pulling together initiative grant. invasive vines had overrun the shifting ecosystem of the coastline. through our grant, the weed met its match. the carolinas beach vitex task force, a collective of private citizens, state and federal agencies, and nonprofits, literally pulled together to restore 5,550 acres of beachfront and barrier islands. at field days, workshops and symposia, the task force educated over 7,000 people on the threats of beach vitex to native dune communities in north and south carolina, earning it the 2007 pulling together community spirit award. in addition, it was instrumental in convincing local nurseries and landscapers to voluntarily discontinue the sale and use of beach vitex along the beachfront. such cooperative efforts, which also included contributions from educational institutions and local businesses, are critical to providing the consistent stewardship needed to keep our wildlife numbers on the rise.
