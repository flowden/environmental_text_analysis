 forests, rivers and wetlands filter pollution and store excess water, so maintaining the health of those ecosystems is critical. but every ecosystem is different. how do we assess their health in a simple, standardized way? this is the problem conservation international has solved with the freshwater health index (fhi), an innovative tool for gauging the state of some of the most important ecosystems on the planet. scouring through available data on pollution, land-cover changes and water flows, scientists are able to “score” a freshwater system on numerous characteristics. the fhi has been implemented in six basins across asia and latin america, resulting in crucial data for decision-makers there — including the ability to model future scenarios — and soon will be expanding into africa. a new web-based platform will launch this year as well, enabling users to more easily access tools and conduct assessments. in places plagued by lack of a common foundation for environmental decision-making, the freshwater health index could become the gold standard for freshwater assessments and a powerful tool for collaborative conservation of humanity’s most precious resource.
