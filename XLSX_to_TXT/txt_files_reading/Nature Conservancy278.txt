 the penobscot river restoration project is an innovative effort to reopen almost 1,000 miles of habitat along the river and its tributaries to sea-run fish by removing two dams and building a state-of-the-art fish bypass around a third. this effort required an unprecedented partnership between a power company, a native american tribe, six environmental groups and numerous state and federal agencies and riverside communities. the project resolves long-standing disagreements over how best to restore native sea-run fish and their habitat while balancing the need for hydropower production. an important member of the partnership, the conservancy helped secure federal funds for the project and is part of the scientific team assessing its restoration benefits.
