 since april 2009, wwf has partnered with the alaska marine conservation council, amassing signatures from over 800 bristol bay fishermen opposed to offshore oil and gas development. when secretary of the interior ken salazar visited dillingham, alaska (a hub of bristol bay), wwf staff and local friends rallied nearly 200 people for a meeting in the school gymnasium. mr. salazar heard firsthand their strong opposition to offshore development. thanks to wwf’s international presence, we have engaged similarly effective spokesmen from norway, primarily barents sea fishermen whose livelihoods also have been threatened by offshore development. it’s just not worth the risk. many superlatives describe bristol bay, but perhaps most important is that this is one of those exceptionally rare places in the u.s. where the ecosystem is healthy enough to support an entire economy. the people who live here want to keep it that way. fisherman thomas tilden points out that bristol bay is the engine for the bering sea fishery, which is worth over $2 billion a year, and that drilling would bring in just $7.7 billion over 25 years. “it’s just not worth the risk,” he says.
