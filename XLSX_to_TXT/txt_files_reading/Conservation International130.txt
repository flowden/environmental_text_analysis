 mangroves are a critical nursing ground for marine life. and there may be no greater natural ally in the fight against climate change than mangroves, which store massive amounts of so-called “blue carbon.” in the coming year, ci will complete the first large-scale carbon-credit system designed specifically for blue carbon. the new approach will help dozens of countries protect these incredible ecosystems while helping them include blue carbon in their emissions cuts agreed to under the paris agreement. working with the international partnership for blue carbon, ci will expand awareness and action by governments and the private sector while building pilot projects in countries with the biggest stores of blue carbon including costa rica, ecuador, indonesia, liberia and the philippines.
