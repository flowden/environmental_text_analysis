 in this thirsty landscape, life has always depended upon its scarce water. cuatro ciénegas, a rare desert oasis in mexico’s chihuahuan desert, is home to small communities where generations have used the water for crops, livestock and other needs. but in recent years, over- use has harmed this fragile ecosystem. with the help of the nature conservancy and the mexican government, the community of cuatro ciénegas is now protecting its precious resource through conservation. today, the topaz-colored pools and their rare desert creatures are rebounding to life. and people are benefiting as well: the conservancy is helping farmers implement new techniques both to save water and earn farmers much more from their harvests.
