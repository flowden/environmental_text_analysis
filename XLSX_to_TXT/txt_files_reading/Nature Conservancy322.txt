 teaming up to reduce the threat of climate change. the reality of human-induced climate change is increasingly accepted by the public. and public perception of the causes usually focuses on belching smokestacks and highways choked with automobiles. but rampant cutting of tropical forests is also a major contributor to the greenhouse gases that are released into our atmosphere. if deforestation is such a big part of the problem, then reversing the trend should play a major role in the solution. the nature conservancy has been working with a host of partners for more than a decade to incorporate climate change considerations into the conservation of tropical forests on a global scale. building market incentives to keep forests standing and reforesting large tracks that have already been cleared are twin strategies to reduce global carbon emissions. and there is a role to play for everyone. actions taken by governments, organizations and individuals around the world are all required to create a solution to this global problem.
