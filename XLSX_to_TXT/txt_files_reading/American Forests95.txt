 american forests’ citygreen software was the centerpiece of environmental education initiatives in charlotte, north carolina, and a carroll county (md) school system project to restore american chestnuts. to document the ecosystem: services of trees and green infra- structure, we conducted an urban ecosystem analysis for the city of san antonio. we also concluded a detailed analysis for albuquerque using high resolution satellite data, and began an analysis for the city of chattanooga. with support from the u.s. forest service, we expanded our systems-based approach to regional ecosystems, and began work on green infrastructure projects with state transportation departments and the epa’s green highways program. our three-year collaboration with the american planning association, the international society of arboriculture, and the usda forest service resulted in the release of planning the urban forest, a manual to help city planners adopt a green infrastructure approach and incorporate trees into the planning process.
