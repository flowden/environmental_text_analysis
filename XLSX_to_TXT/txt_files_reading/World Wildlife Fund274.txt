 13 long-term financial support is always one of wwf’s greatest challenges and we are especially grateful to our loyal donors who each year enable us to keep our many vital programmes going. the oak foundation: restoring europe’s fisheries european countries are legally committed to managing their fisheries sustainably. despite this, fish stocks are still declining in european waters. today the adults of several species number just 10 per cent of what they were 30 years ago. the oak foundation’s substantial financial support is helping wwf to develop a holistic management plan for the recovery of europe’s marine ecosystems by strengthening and implementing the reformed eu common fisheries policy. the mava foundation: a blueprint for action wwf and another of its partners, the mava foundation, aim to change the way governments protect biodiversity. using the work programme of the convention on biological diversity (cbd) as a blueprint for action, wwf is engaging scientists, government officials, ngos, local authorities, and business people to set up well-managed networks of protected areas in some 25 countries. the programme, to be implemented over five years, involves trans-boundary planning that wwf is uniquely placed to promote. through this work, we hope to influence the 188 parties to the convention and accelerate their conservation actions.
