 fighting for tuna the triennial meeting of cites (the convention on international trade in endangered species), the world’s most broadly supported wildlife trade agreement, fails to ban international trade of the spectacular atlantic bluefin tuna. undaunted, wwf continues to mount campaigns and engage industry to save all tuna from overexploitation due to unsustainable trade and an increasingly ravenous global appetite for the fish. we’ve joined global leaders in science and in the tuna industry to create the international seafood sustainability foundation — whose membership represents 60 percent of the global tuna catch that is processed into cans — to support groundbreaking conservation efforts to track tuna catch and enforce sustainable practices. we also work with local communities to incorporate sustainability into their fishing practices.
