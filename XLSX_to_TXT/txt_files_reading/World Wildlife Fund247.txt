 in 2009, wwf and the carnegie airborne institute piloted light detection and ranging (lidar) technology to develop high resolution maps of the carbon held in tropical forests. lidar uses a sophisticated laser-based carbon- reading mechanism, flown above the forest, to measure the carbon stored in units as small as individual trees. the first project, in madre de dios forest in peru, quantified the forest’s carbon stock—data that confirms the impact of deforestation on climate change. this will allow the country to leverage economic incentives that reward nations which keep their forests intact. wwf is now working to take lidar worldwide. in march, with the help of the grantham family and the finnish government, wwf and finnish forestry consulting firm arbonaut used lidar to gather a sweeping set of carbon-storage data for nepal’s forests. this data will be used to calculate carbon credits that will directly benefit nepalese communities and the wildlife- harboring forests of the terai arc.
