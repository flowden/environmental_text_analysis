 the health and vibrancy of our nation’s wetlands are protected by the clean water act (cwa). under the cwa, an activity that causes adverse impacts to wetlands is required to be authorized and mitigated through the issuance of a permit. one option available to permittees to satisfy their wetland mitigation requirement is the payment of a fee (in lieu of actually performing a mitigation project) to an authorized in-lieu fee (ilf) program. our idea department administers an ilf program in california to support the permitting and mitigation work of the u.s. army corps of engineers (sacramento district), along with other federal and california state agencies. the ilf program was approved by these agencies in 2014 and uses the proceeds of “in-lieu” payments to fund and implement watershed-based wetland mitigation projects as approved by the agencies. one such project approved by the agencies and completed in 2020 was the flying m ranch vernal pool preservation project in merced county, california. this project entailed the creation of a conservation easement over 845 acres of vernal pool grassland, including more than 100 acres of vernal pools and streams, for the benefit of threatened and endangered vernal pool species. another 2020 project will restore and protect a 9-acre montane meadow in the town of truckee, california, providing vital habitat for native plants and wildlife.
