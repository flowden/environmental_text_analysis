 critical to our success in movement building is cultivating the skills necessary for staff and volunteer leaders to work effectively with a wide range of partners. nellis kennedy- howard, sierra club’s first-ever director of equity, inclusion, and justice, works with staff, volunteers, and members to create a culture where people from all walks of life feel included and valued; to build a foundation of equity and justice that informs all our work; and to promote ongoing education, training, and personal growth. the sierra club and the sierra club foundation join in solidarity with low-income communities, communities of color, and other groups who are most impacted by pollution and the effects of climate change, including indigenous nations. the sierra club supported tribal nations’ right to clean water and clean air, urging the rejection of the dakota access pipeline and joining the lummi nation to defeat a proposed coal export terminal in the pacific northwest. sierra club’s military outdoor program helps veterans experience the healing power of nature and lead efforts to protect our wild lands. in june, a team of veterans set out to explore the pristine arctic national wildlife refuge, adding their powerful voices to a diverse coalition to permanently protect america’s last wild frontier. the power of organized resistance and allyship is unstoppable. by building relationships and lifting up the voices of others across movements, we’re building a larger, more powerful social movement that addresses not just climate change, but also racial and economic inequities.
