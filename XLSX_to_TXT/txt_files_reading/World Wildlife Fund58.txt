 the most effective way to ensure the long-term survival of plants and ani- mals is through conservation of entire “ecoregions” (see page 4) – extensive, largely unspoilt places that support large numbers of species. the miombo savannah woodlands, which cover 350 million hectares across ten countries of southern africa (angola, botswana, democratic republic of congo, malawi, mozambique, namibia, south africa, tanzania, zambia, and zimbabwe) are home to some of the most important mammal populations left in africa. among them are black rhino, african elephant, african hunting dog, and cheetah, along with the slender-nosed crocodile and many lesser-known reptiles, birds, insects, fish, and plants. more than half of the estimated 8,500 plant species there are found nowhere else on earth. the biggest threat to wildlife is the large and rapidly growing human population and its demand for agricultural land. in addition to forest clearance for crops, wood is taken for building and fuel, leaving increasingly large holes in forest cover. as the soil becomes eroded and infertile, so more woods are cleared and the cycle is repeated. wwf’s response has been to develop programmes in which local communities manage their own resources. the establishment of conservancies – in which fees are levied for the use of environmental resources – across southern africa is yielding significant benefits for nature and for people, with profits ploughed back into the community through grants to local schools. for wwf, wildlife conservation is inextricably linked to human development.
