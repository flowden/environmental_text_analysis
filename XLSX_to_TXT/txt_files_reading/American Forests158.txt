 the national urban forest council (nufc) was founded by afa in 1981 to link federal, state, and local governments, as well as citizen’s groups, to develop and share information about community forests. in 1989, the council coordinated a 400-city scientific street tree survey to document the “state of today’s urban forest.’’ designed and analyzed under the leadership of dr. james kielbaso of michigan state university, the survey establishes a solid base of information on the number, condition, and species of trees in urban forests. an earlier survey by the council in 1986 found four trees dying or removed along city streets in major cities for every new one planted. this statistic helped tree enthusiasts throughout the country win battles for greater tree- care budgets. the new survey suggests that conditions are improving, particularly in mid-sized cities, although we are still not planting as many trees as are dying, and over half (61million) of our planting spaces remain vacant. there is still a big planting job to be done!
