 breeding tufted puffins and many other bird species are winging their way back to hawadax island in alaskaâ€™s aleutian archipelago after an eradication of invasive rats that had made the island uninhabitable for many native species. once called rat island, hawadax is coming back to life thanks to a successful conservation intervention championed by the conservancy with the u.s. fish and wildlife service and island conservation, prompting the native aleutian-pribilof islands association to rename the island. in the tongass national forest, the conservancy is working with the u.s. forest service and others to restore salmon streams by recreating pools and eddies in damaged rivers so that young fish can grow big and avoid predators before migrating to the sea. nature.org/ar-alaska
