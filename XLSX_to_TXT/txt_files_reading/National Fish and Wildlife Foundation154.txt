 demand for freshwater continues to grow across the united states, putting unprecedented pressure on streams already degraded by a host of factors. nfwf supports the critical work of organizations such as trout unlimited, the freshwater trust, american rivers and water conservation districts across the west to lease or purchase water rights from willing sellers to keep water in-stream to benefit fish and wildlife. these same organizations work to improve water quality through the restoration of wetlands, rivers and floodplain habitats. such efforts directly benefit many imperiled species of fish, including these threatened bull trout in the pacific northwest.
