 helped establish the world’s largest network of marine reserves and ensure lasting legacy for california’s underwater parks in september, with ocean conservancy’s support through a coalition of environmental organizations, president obama expanded the pacific remote islands marine national monument. this action places over 400,000 additional square miles of ocean under permanent protection from activities like offshore drilling, undersea mining, and commercial fishing. this expansion makes the monument the largest protected area of any kind–on land or water. the expansion also permanently safeguarded over 130 undersea mountains—known hotspots of biodiversity and home to threatened and endangered species like green and hawksbill turtles, reef sharks, parrotfish, dolphins, and whales. in addition, in california, after spending a decade to make the nation’s first statewide network of underwater parks a reality, we shifted gears to ensure a lasting legacy. specifically, we worked with key state agencies to improve coordination of proposed coastal and ocean planning projects to ensure they do not interfere with the state’s newly protected areas.
