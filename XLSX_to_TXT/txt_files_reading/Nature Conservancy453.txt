 the challenge: at the edge of the continental shelf, where the eastern bering sea meets the deeper western waters of the aleutian basin, lies an area so biologi- cally rich that conservationists call it “the galapagos of the north.” here, ocean currents from the southwest bring nutrient-laden waters to the surface near the pribilof islands, attracting some of the largest breeding colonies of marine birds and marine mammals in north america. throughout the 20th century, commercial whaling and fishing, pollution and non-native species have stressed the native wildlife of the bering sea and its islands, which now may be suffering the added burden of rapid climate change. many populations of marine mammals, birds and fish have plummeted; fishing, a way of life for local people, has suffered. preserving this fragile, threatened ecosystem is critical to the survival of the wild creatures and human communities it has sustained for generations. how we’re making a difference: the conservancy is working with pribilof island native organizations, the world wildlife fund, the fishing industry and government agencies to find common ground among the diverse constituencies with an interest in protecting bering sea habitats and species. together these partners will explore various marine protection strategies and make recommendations to the north pacific fisheries management council. such teamwork builds on the ongoing cooperation between the conservancy and the local pribilof islands stewardship program, in which alaska native youths disentangle fur seals from fishing debris, monitor shorelines, help defend against invasive species and reaffirm their role as stewards of their islands’ natural heritage. these conservation partners are working to reverse the decline of the pribilofs’ vast gatherings of wildlife, including northern fur seals, whose numbers over the last 50 years have shrunk by more than half, and the area’s most important nesting seabird colonies.
