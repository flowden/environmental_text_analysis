 tom ingersoll, a successful satellite entrepreneur, was surprised last year when he got a call from edf’s chief scientist, dr. steven hamburg. hamburg said edf wanted to build and launch a satellite to help fight climate change— and wondered if ingersoll would consider leading the effort. “i thought, ‘wow, that’s kind of crazy for a nonprofit,’” recalls ingersoll, the former ceo of skybox imaging, a satellite imaging company acquired by google in 2014. after studying the technological hurdles, ingersoll signed on to head the project. “it will be difficult but doable,” he says, “and the potential benefits for society are huge.” the new satellite, methanesat, will track methane emissions from oil and gas fields with unprecedented precision. it will also be capable of measuring emissions from landfills and agriculture. the space mission—the first by an environmental group— is an example of how technological innovation is unleashing a new era of environmental progress. “edf will be a trailblazer for the concept of using the power of space and remote sensing to address a wide range of problems on a not-for-profit basis,” says ingersoll. the sky, it turns out, is not the limit.
