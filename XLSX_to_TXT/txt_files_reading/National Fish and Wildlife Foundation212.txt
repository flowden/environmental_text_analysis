 nfwf helps protect and improve migration corridors in western states for pronghorn, elk and mule deer. many of the migration-related grants awarded by nfwf in 2020 focused on fencing modifications, dangerous road crossings and wintering grounds for these large ungulates. examples of our 2020 grant-making include: the colorado department of transportation won a $480,400 grant to install fencing that will guide mule deer and elk to an underpass being constructed in the northwest part of the state, as well as a $267,900 grant to reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions at a crossing near salida. nfwf awarded nearly $310,000 to the mule deer foundation in idaho to improve 24 miles of fencing, protect habitat, and improve management on 255,000 acres to benefit mule deer, elk and resident species. the new mexico association of conservation districts will leverage a $250,000 grant from nfwf to restore grassland habitat and modify 40 miles of fencing. such projects are particularly important for pronghorn, which can’t jump over fences — they must crawl underneath, risking injury and entrapment. the wyoming game and fish department was awarded a grant of $249,000 to restore native grassland and sagebrush habitat and improve 19 miles of fencing in the wintering grounds of mule deer completing an arduous, 150-mile migration between summer and winter ranges.
