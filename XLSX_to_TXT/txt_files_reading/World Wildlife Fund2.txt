 as the evidence increases that mankind’s footprint is ever more threatening to the long-term survival of our planet, the need to protect our environment rises inexorably to the top of the world’s political, economic, and social agendas. in a world where globalization is driving rapid revolutions in commerce, comunications, and cultures, i believe that we must develop new means of governing ourselves, at all levels of society. the great potential of this new governance lies with civil society and non-governmental organizations (ngos) becoming a vital third force in influencing – and changing – the often harmful ways in which the governmental and private sectors are using our global resources. over four decades wwf has evolved from being a relatively small group concerned mainly with the conservation of species into an international ngo with a global network working on most of the major challenges of environmental protection and, through this, of sustainable development. these challenges demand new responses from wwf – in our conservation programme, our campaigns, our communications, and our organizational culture. we are addressing these issues and my goal as president is to ensure that wwf continues to be an outstanding, action-oriented organization working for the environment, for nature – and for people. this annual report summarizes the scope and achievements of the whole wwf network. we present it with thanks to all those who have supported us so far – and with the hope that it will convince many more to support our work in future.
