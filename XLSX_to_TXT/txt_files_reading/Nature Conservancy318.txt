 tommy e. remengesau, jr., is the exiting president of palau, a small island nation in the western pacific. on november 5, 2005, remengesau called on his peers to join him in the micronesia challenge to effectively conserve 30 percent of nearshore marine resources and 20 percent of terrestrial resources by 2020. for palau, the environment is our economy. our people rely on the food and income the reefs provide—and coming generations will, too. on our small planet, the actions of one affect all, and if islands fail to stand together to protect our natural resources and cultural pasts, we will have no future. support from the international community, coupled with tangible community, state and national commitments to conservation, are critical ingredients to achieving our national and global protected area goals. the $3 million pledge from the nature conservancy demonstrates the serious commitment the republic of palau and the conservancy have made to help us effec- tively preserve our important natural habitats. it is the proverbial pebble sending ripples across the world’s oceans, and palau is proud that pebble came from its shores.”
