 until the early 20th century, the colorado river flowed freely to its delta, where wetlands and forests flourished on two million acres. but so much water has been drawn from the river that it dried up before reaching the gulf of california. now, thanks to an agreement that edf and our u.s. and mexican partners helped broker, some of the original ecosystem can thrive, benefiting farmers and wildlife. the pact provides a framework for sharing water and for water conservation. already, farmers are getting paid for selling water rights to our water trust. this marks the first time mexico and the united states have agreed to release water to restore the deltaâ€™s ecological health.
