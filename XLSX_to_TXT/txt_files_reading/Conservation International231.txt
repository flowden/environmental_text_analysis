 protecting nature? priceless the priceless planet coalition, launched in january 2020, was designed to leverage the full scale of mastercard’s business, its technology, its brand, and partner ecosystem all the way to the cardholders, to act on climate change at an unprecedented scale. mastercard chose conservation international and the world resources institute as restoration partners to help the priceless planet coalition achieve its initial goal of regrowing 100 million trees. the priceless planet coalition is not just about planting trees. the partners are dedicated to regrowing forests in the geographies that represent the greatest potential for positive impacts toward our global goals for climate, communities and biodiversity. the coalition will employ science-based best practices for the selection, implementation, and long-term monitoring of its restoration efforts. one of conservation international’s historic strengths is our culture of partnerships, through which we can make an impact for nature far above what any single organization can achieve. last year, we worked with some of the world’s most prominent companies to act with urgency to protect nature. here are two highlights from 2020. p&g promise consumer goods giant p&g announced it would reduce the company’s greenhouse gas emissions across its operations, in close collaboration with conservation international and other partners, becoming climate-neutral for the decade by supporting natural climate solutions. the company aims to fund projects that protect, improve and restore critical ecosystems where irrecoverable carbon is stored, while supporting local communities and economic recovery.
