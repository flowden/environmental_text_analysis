 from oyster die-offs to slower coral reef recovery and growth, the impacts of ocean acidification (oa) are being felt by coastal communities in the u.s. and around the world. as a founding partner of the international alliance to combat ocean acidification, ocean conservancy is helping to grow alliance membership, uniting states, countries and others worldwide to address the issue by developing action plans aimed at taking steps to mitigate the impacts of oa and curb carbon dioxide pollution — the root cause of oa. most recently, new zealand, iceland, fiji and sweden joined the alliance — bringing the current membership to 58. additionally, we produced a video focused on oa and coral reefs in florida and its potential impacts to coastal industries. congresswoman ileana ros-lehtinen (r-fl) gave a floor speech on oa, describing its causes and day-to-day consequences and commended ocean conservancy and our video for championing this issue.
