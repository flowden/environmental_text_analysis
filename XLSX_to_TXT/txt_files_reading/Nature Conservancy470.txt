 the mission of the nature conservancy is to preserve the plants, animals and natural communities that represent the diversity of life on earth by protecting the lands and waters they need to survive. the conservancy protects specific places where plant and animal species can survive for generations to come. we employ a scientific, systematic analysis to identify places large enough in scale and rich enough in plant and animal species to ensure meaningful conservation results. we call these areas the last great places. at each place, we employ a range of strategies tailored to local circumstances. we buy land. we help other landowners manage their properties. we facilitate public-private partnerships. we engage the business community. we collaborate with like-minded partners. we seek pragmatic solutions. by employing this scientific planning approach — called conservation by design — we are developing a blueprint for action throughout the americas, asia and the pacific islands. the conservancy is committed to working with partners to protect all the places identified by that blueprint. the result is a network of tangible successes — places protected at an appropriate scale with the cooperation of local partners. places that in turn influence how others pursue conservation in their communities.
