 wwf estimates that the amount of forest protected areas actually established, much of it as a result of gifts to the earth (see page 17), is now almost 32 million hectares – up from 20 million hectares a year ago. this is approximately one per cent of the total world forest area. ut initial investigation shows that some types of forest are well below a one per cent protec- tion level, so the “representation” component of the first target is far from being achieved.there are also a great number of “paper parks”which exist in name only, so management effectiveness is also a key issue. with close to 20 million hectares already certified by the forest stewardship council (fsc), wwf is, however, well on its way to achieving the campaign’s second target. fsc certification is a system of forest inspection plus a means of tracking timber and paper through a “chain of custody” from raw material to finished product,to ensure that the prod- ucts come from well-managed forests. working with other ngos such as green- peace and friends of the earth, together with foresters, retailers, and social organizations, wwf helped set up the fsc in 1993. more than 8,000 products worldwide – ranging from wooden doors to hairbrushes and office stationery to toilet paper – now carry the fsc certification eco-label.
