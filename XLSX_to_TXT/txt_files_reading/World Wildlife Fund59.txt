 more than ever before, the world is facing a freshwater crisis. over 1.5 billion people already lack safe drinking water and, at current rates of consumption, almost half the world’s projected population will face serious water shortages within 25 years. on top of this, pollution forces 3.3 billion people to use contaminated water, causing about 250 million cases of water-related diseases each year, with some 5 to 10 million deaths. although 70 per cent of the earth is covered by water, only 2.5 per cent of this is fresh water. and since most of it is locked away in glaciers or deep underground, only 0.25 per cent is actually readily available. much of this available fresh water is stored in wetlands. yet half the world’s wetlands have been destroyed in the last 100 years through pollution or drainage for agriculture and construction. few people realize the value of these ecosystems, which pro- vide not only water, but also food such as fish and rice, medicinal plants, building materials, and so on. and not only goods: wetlands also protect from flooding and act like highly efficient sewage treatment works, absorbing chemicals, filtering pollutants, and neutralizing harmful bacteria. the goal of wwf’s living waters programme is to achieve the protection and sound management of 250 million hectares of the world’s most important wetlands by 2010. to date, efforts by the organization have led to the safeguarding of 20 million hectares. alongside this, wwf is working towards restoring at least 50 large river basins – such as the danube in europe, the mekong in asia, the niger in africa, and the orinoco in south america – and campaigning for changes in government water policies and private sector practices. work such as this is becoming increasingly urgent to help prevent the disastrous flooding that struck many parts of the world this yea
