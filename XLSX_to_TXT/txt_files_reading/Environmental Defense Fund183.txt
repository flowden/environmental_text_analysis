 two years ago, edf teamed up with google earth outreach to find, quantify and map natural gas leaks under city streets, using street view cars. with researchers at colorado state university, we developed an innovative way to analyze the data we collected, and to validate our findings, we worked with utilities like national grid. this year, we published interactive maps on edf.org of boston, indianapolis and new york cityâ€™s staten island. the resulting national media coverage raised awareness of the climate impacts of leaking methane. we are now mapping our next three cities. our approach makes pollution visible to the public and provides utilities with a new tool to cut these emissions.
