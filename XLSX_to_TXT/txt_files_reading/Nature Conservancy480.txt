 on marthaâ€™s vineyard, amid some of the most coveted real estate in the country, the nature conservancy purchased and protect- ed 103 acres of rare sandplain grasslands habitat. one of the largest undeveloped tracts on the island, the land was originally slated to become part of a large and controversial golf course. the massachusetts chapter purchased the sensitive land and sold it to a conservation-minded buyer with provisions that restrict how the land can be developed and enable the conservancy to restore the native natural communities. in late july 2001,the conservancy continued the effort by purchasing another 215 acres of sandplain grasslands that had been slated for subdivision.
