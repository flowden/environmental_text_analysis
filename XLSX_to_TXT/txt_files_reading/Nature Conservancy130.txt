 the need to protect nature is what propelled the nature conservancy into existence in 1951. initially, protection took the form of buying land and setting it aside. but we soon learned that true protection requires diverse actions across entire land and water systems, including areas where people cultivate sustenance from nature. today we protect and restore lands and waters on an ever-larger scale, ensuring that whole rivers endure, clean and abundant; that previously degraded coastlines and reefs are revitalized; and that working landscapes remain intact for the benefit of wildlife and people. the following 12 achievements from the past year exemplify the many ways we are protecting land, water, oceans, cities and our climate on a systemwide scale around the world.
