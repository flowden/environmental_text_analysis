 when congress passed the frank r. lautenberg chemical safety for the 21st century act—by voice vote in the senate and 403–12 in the house—it was a victory that would not have been possible without edf action, our political advocacy partner. edf action, unlike edf itself, can engage in unlimited lobbying of congress and state legislatures. this provides the muscle to fight for environmental legislation while cutting through misleading arguments of well-funded opponents. while the 2016 election signals challenges ahead, ultimately americans strongly support environmental protection and will press their elected representatives to deliver. edf action is working to build a bench of environmental champions among both republican and democratic officials. we are also active at the state level. for example, in wyoming we worked with governor matt mead, the wyoming outdoor council and local community members in the upper green river basin—the heart of the state’s natural gas country—to enact some of the nation’s strongest air pollution laws for oil and gas drilling. no major environmental law has ever passed congress without bipartisan backing. even in a polarized political environment, edf action will continue to fight for our values and create coalitions for environmental defense.
