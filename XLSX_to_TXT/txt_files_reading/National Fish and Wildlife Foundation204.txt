 the yearly migrations of wildlife across our nation’s vast landscapes represent a fundamental and fascinating part of american life. who could imagine an autumn without geese and ducks flying south in their distinctive v formations? what kind of spring would it be if songbirds and hummingbirds failed to make an appearance at our bird feeders and in our parks? how dull would it be, sitting on a beach in the summertime without lively little plovers and sandpipers to entertain us at the water’s edge? many of the most iconic and beloved wildlife species in the united states have become so deeply rooted in our culture precisely because they migrate. we mark the seasons by their arrival and departure, from baby sea turtles hatching along florida’s beaches to humpback whales giving birth off hawaii. we marvel at their journeys, from the 2,500-mile, nonstop flight of whimbrels to the mysterious, multi-generational migration of monarch butterflies. we depend on these yearly bounties for subsistence, prosperity and quality of life, from life-sustaining harvests of salmon in the pacific northwest and alaska to recreational hunting of waterfowl in arkansas and elk, moose and deer in the rocky mountains. protecting the ability of these animals to migrate, both in the immediate future and for generations to come, represents a major focus of our investments. the foundation and its network of funding partners and on-the-ground implementers act quickly to address direct threats to wildlife on the move. we also protect migratory routes facing long-term threats from development and climate change. nfwf leads the way in protecting migrations across our nation by putting conservation dollars to work wherever they generate the greatest benefits to migrating wildlife, from state and federal lands to private farms and ranches, suburban neighborhoods, remote islands and major metropolitan areas.
