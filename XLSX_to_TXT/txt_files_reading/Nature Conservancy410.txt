 why the conservancy works here: cuatro ciénegas is one of several desert spring ecosystems remaining in north america and is now part of a global network of protected areas. who lives here: scattered communities share the 200,000-acre valley with the rare desert freshwater pools that harbor rare plants and animals. what the conservancy is doing: the nature conservancy has worked with local partners to gain a water concession from a nearby farm co-operative, protecting the water levels in the freshwater pools while still providing enough irrigation so nearby farms can prosper. this conservation effort also helps the economy of the nearby town of cuatro ciénegas, as the pools are a popular tourist destination.
