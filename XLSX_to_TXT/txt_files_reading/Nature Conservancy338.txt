 marcela aguiñaga vallejo is the minister of environment for ecuador. aguiñaga announced ecuador’s commitment to the 10 million hectare initiative at a u.n. conference on biodiversity conservation in bonn, germany, in may 2008. “for ecuador, the program of work on protected areas is absolutely important to aid us in creating the most biodiverse national system of protected areas. it allows countries to demonstrate their commitment to conservation. the 10 million hectare initiative looks to strengthen com- mitments from countries and provides the opportunity to combine forces to maintain the environment and biodiversity within the region. if all of these countries come together as one, we’ll be able to meet the conservation commitments we’ve made to the program of work on protected areas for 2015. i believe that the initiative ecuador has taken with its commitment to the 10 million hectare initiative will be seen as advanced for such a small country. i hope it will make other countries commit to protecting their biodiversity. the most important effect this commitment has on the people is that it grows a public environmental conscience. when you get people involved in the process of decision making about their natural resources, they see that it’s worth it to protect them, and they become our first allies.”
