 similar efforts are underway to conserve coastal habitats as part of the american oystercatcher initiative. only 11 ,000 oystercatchers remain today along the atlantic and gulf coasts. a single hurricane or other disaster could easily eliminate a large portion of the population. nfwf is partnering with numerous federal, state, and nongovernmental groups in an effort to increase the imperiled birdâ€™s population by 30% in 10 years. the plan includes efforts to manage predators, limit disturbance to nesting birds in their preferred coastal areas, and create new habitats. previous nfwf grants helped the manomet center for conservation sciences conduct atlantic coast surveys for american oystercatchers, resulting in the most accurate population data to date.
