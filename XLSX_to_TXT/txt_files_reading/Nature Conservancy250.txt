 in 1990, conservancy staffer chuck cook arrived in palau with an ice chest, a fax machine, two legal pads and a pen — ready to create the conservancy’s first “office” outside the western hemisphere. the conservancy chose palau as its first endeavor in asia pacific because of its extraordinary marine biodiversity, and because the people of palau wanted to conserve their natural world but lacked many of the resources to do so. success here required developing a program that would strengthen local conservation leadership while collaborating with regional and international partners to provide technical, scientific and financial resources. in 1994, the conservancy helped establish the nation’s first civic group, the palau conservation society (pcs) — an approach to conservation that was designed to endure and be fi nancially self-sufficient. this type of community-based conservation has become a pillar of the conservancy’s work across the world. in palau, pcs helped bridge the gap between conservation-minded citizens and the government. about a decade later, palauan leadership inspired the ambitious micronesia challenge, a five- nation commitment to effectively conserve at least 30 percent of near-shore marine resources and 20 percent of terrestrial resources across micronesia by 2020. a conservancy discovery on the reefs of palau helped lay the groundwork for the scientific principles of reef resilience. after studying reefs in palau that survived the 1998 mass coral bleaching event, scientists are now using that data to understand what makes some reefs more resilient to warmer waters and bleaching events. this reef resilience strategy is being employed across the world — from papua new guinea to the florida keys.
