 the parks in peril (pip) program began in 1990 as an emergency effort to protect imperiled natural areas in latin america and the caribbean by building the capacity of independent, self-sustaining conservation organizations. at the time, many parks in this region were just “paper parks” — legally decreed but not actually protected because of the limited resources of the regions’ governments. over its 17-year lifespan, pip helped convert 45 of these paper parks — totaling 45 million acres — into fully functional protected areas. the conservancy, usaid and other organizations worked with local partners to provide necessary infrastructure, conservation knowledge and hands-on experience in park management and development. we also generated sustainable finance mechanisms that eventually leveraged more than $450 million from other entities and worked with government agencies on supportive policies. one key to pip’s success was its emphasis on engaging local communities to ensure proper management for long-term conservation — an important conservancy strategy. for example, bolivia’s noel kempff mercado national park (the site of our climate action project) used pip funding to train park rangers, who worked with local residents to eliminate illegal logging and dramatically reduce poaching.
