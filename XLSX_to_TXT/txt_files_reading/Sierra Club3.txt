 2009 marked the sixth year that the beyond coal campaign has been wielding the sharp edge of the clean energy sword—with the goal of ridding the united states of coal power, our most carbon-intensive energy source, by 2030. in 2009, the beyond coal team set out to achieve the following goals: ensure that none of the 100 remaining conventional coal plant proposals begin construction. not one new coal plant broke ground in 2009. sierra club blocked 26 proposed coal plants last year, defeating a total of 115 plants since the campaign began. stop or stall 90% of the proposed mountaintop removal (mtr) mines in appalachia and prevent new or expanded mining in alaska. in 2009, the epa agreed to put 79 mtr permits on hold and is considering using veto power for the first time in 37 years to stop the largest mtr mine in appalachia. implement stronger public health and environmental regulations to compel conventional coal plant developers and operators to assume the true costs of dirty coal power. sierra club activists sent more than 300,000 messages to the obama administration supporting strong federal rules on coal pollution. in 2009, the epa issued its endangerment finding, which determined that greenhouse gases threaten public health and must be regulated, and proposed a new rule to regulate co2 from large sources. the epa set the process in motion to strengthen regulations for smog, mercury, and sulfur pollution, and to establish long-overdue rules for the disposal of toxic coal ash. retire at least 1,000 megawatts (mw) of aging coal capacity through focused litigation and administrative advocacy. launching a new anti-coal lawsuit every 10 days in 2009, we were able to retire 17,753 mw of new coal-fired energy in 2009. legal actions in 2009, sierra club’s legal team filed an average of one legal action a week challenging coal projects, including 34 legal actions against proposed and existing coal plants.
