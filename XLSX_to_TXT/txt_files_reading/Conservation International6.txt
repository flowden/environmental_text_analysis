 ci is saving species protecting their homes and making discoveries along the way. in fy07, our teams of local and international scientists explored forests of brazil, colombia, ghana, guyana, madagascar, the philippines and new guinea, revealing a host of highly threatened species and species new to science, while improving our knowledge of these areas. new species discovered included a mouse lemur, a poison dart frog, a gecko, two lizards and at least 19 katydids, an invertebrate species resembling grasshoppers. such findings can compel decision-makers in government and business to protect crucial habitat for biodiversity and to consider economic alternatives that benefit local communities. complementing these discoveries are assessments conducted by ci, iucn and partners to inform the iucn red list of threatened species, a global standard for the conservation status of species that influences conservation action and policy. ci and partners are currently involved in several ambitious initiatives to assess, among others, the status of some 5,500 mammals, 8,200 reptiles and 20,000 marine species. fy07 delivered the first-ever assessments of reef-building corals, providing the first look at the pattern of biodiversity at risk in the ocean—as well as the first set of results from the global reptile assessment. in addition, support from ci and the critical ecosystem partnership fund (cepf) helped scientists and government authorities successfully nominate nearly 10,000 square kilometers of sichuan giant panda sanctuaries for inclusion on the unesco world heritage list. the sanctuaries are home to more than 30 percent of the world’s giant pandas, as well as other threatened species such as the red panda, snow leopard and clouded leopard.
