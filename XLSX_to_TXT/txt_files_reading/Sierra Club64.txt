 scott nicol has been involved in sierra clubâ€™s borderlands campaign since its inception in 2008 when border walls were getting built in large numbers right in his community. walls and barriers have already been constructed across more than 650 miles of the u.s.-mexico border. these barriers block wildlife migration, cause flooding, and damage pristine wild lands, including wildlife refuges, wilderness areas, and national forests. the sierra club advocates for real solutions, such as comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. scott is one of our most active volunteers, playing a large part in coalition building, organizing, educating the community, and bringing national attention to the issue.
