 american forests’ urban ecosystem assessment center conducted an assessment of the piedmont crescent area, which extends from roanoke, virginia, to birmingham, alabama. this assessment set the course for a larger study, “forest management in the 21st century.” this analysis of the piedmont’s natural and human networks, conducted with the support of the u.s. forest service and many other partners, laid the groundwork for the wealth of data that must be considered as we develop a tool for decision-makers to plan environmentally sustainable growth. analyses of the value of urban ecosystems were also conducted in north carolina in mecklenburg county and in charlotte; in florida in palm beach county and dade county and in miami; and in san antonio, texas, and bellevue, washington. an extensive analysis of the gulf coast in the wake of hurricane katrina demonstrated just how important urban forests are in that region for clean air and water. the urban ecosystem assessment center also developed a canadian version of its groundbreaking citygreen software and conducted an analysis of ottawa.
