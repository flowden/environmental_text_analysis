 western balkan region. having emerged from decades of political oppression and strife, the western balkan region (albania, bosnia and herzegovina, croatia, kosovo, macedonia, montenegro, and serbia) harbors some of the world’s most ecologically intact river systems. known as the “blue heart of europe,” the region is now experiencing a hydropower development boom of global proportions, with more than 2,000 projects already proposed or under construction. the region’s future will depend on society’s ability to reconcile its growing demand for renewable energy with conservation of its outstanding natural heritage. to meet these dual demands, the nature conservancy is working in collaboration with conservation and finance partners to develop science-based solutions for integrating nature conservation upfront into renewable energy build-out, including solar, wind and hydropower. by helping build a brighter future for the balkans, our goal is to establish a global model for how to repower a region in the smartest way possible for both people and nature.
