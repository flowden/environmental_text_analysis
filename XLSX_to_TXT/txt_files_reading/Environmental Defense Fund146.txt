 when sarah vogel first learned that hazardous chemicals were showing up in human breast milk, she realized that hundreds of toxic substances—many not in existence 50 years ago—were now being passed down from one generation to the next. “that’s when i understood the full meaning of the phrase ‘pollution is personal,’” says vogel, now edf’s vp for health. today our bodies bear evidence of toxic emissions from coal-fired power plants and diesel trucks, along with hundreds of hazardous chemicals that have slipped through our flimsy chemical safety net. edf foresees a healthier, more sustainable future, one in which air and water are cleaner and food and consumer goods safer. in 2015, we made significant progress toward that future. we used science, the courts, partnerships, activism and the political process to advance our goals. after two decades of work by edf and our allies, the u.s. senate passed sweeping bipartisan legislation that promises to fix our broken chemical safety system by setting strong, health-based standards against which all chemicals will be assessed. now edf will work with members of both parties to ensure that the strongest possible bill gets through the house-senate negotiations and arrives on the president’s desk. harmful substances that can cause poor health and disease are with us at every stage of our lives. they’re found in the food we eat, the products we buy and the air we breathe. for that reason, every edf program works on improving the health of people, their communities and the natural systems on which human health depends.
