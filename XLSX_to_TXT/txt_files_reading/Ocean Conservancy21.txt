 in july, the u.s. department of commerce issued a short-sighted order to extend the federal private recreational fishing season for red snapper, sanctioning overfishing and threatening rebuilding efforts. ocean conservancy (represented by earthjustice) and environmental defense fund are fighting back against this dangerous precedent. we are jointly litigating against the extended season so that political pressure does not override proven, science-based policy, charting a course for healthy fisheries for generations to come. simultaneously, we are pushing the envelope on new management techniques to meet emerging fisheries challenges. this includes influencing west coast fishery plans to consider larger ecosystem conditions in order to restore and maintain fish stock at healthy levels. and we developed an innovative computer modeling tool that predicts fishermen’s actions — one of the most influential factors when considering how to best manage a fishery — amidst changing ocean conditions and policy landscapes. ocean conservancy, oxford university and other partners are applying the tool internationally, pinpointing solutions for achieving sustainable fisheries globally.
