 atfs celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2011, and marked that milestone by supporting more than 89,000 woodland owners in sustainably managing more than 26 million acres of forestland in america. through atfs, we continued to address the many threats that face woodland owners today, and provided family forest owners with the tools and resources they need to leave their tree farms as a legacy for the future. once again we honored the extraordinary family forest owners who make up atfs with our annual outstanding tree farmer of the year awards, made possible with support from our corporate sponsor, stihl inc. the 2011 national award, which recognizes outstanding sustainable forest management on privately owned woodlands, went to joseph "steve" and janet funk of coeur d’alene, idaho. the funks’ edgecreek tree farm is a 369-acre woodland that has become a valuable tool in demonstrating sustainable management of degraded forests and the pathway to a healthy and thriving forest. through both the american tree farm system (atfs) and project learning tree (plt), the american forest foundation continued to bring people together in 2011—in powerful networks that made a difference from coast to coast. our best hope for the future of sustainable forestry is how we can motivate others to pass on these values.
