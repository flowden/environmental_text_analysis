 to sustain the 21st century economy, we need to see things in a new way. we need to begin to under stand the inter twined patterns and interactions of two systems: human and natural. we need a systems-based framework that results in policy and management structures that foster success, and programs and financing that support rather than fragment system continuity. our piedmont crescent project further demonstrated the goals of this “new framework” : to foster coevolution of our natural and human networks. this project, as well as our city analyses, was showcased at our national conference on urban ecosystems in orlando, florida, in may. with the use of gis technology and our own citygreen software, american forests conducted urban ecosystem assessments to map and measure the value of urban ecosystems in miami/dade county, florida; san antonio, texas; bellevue, washington; and albuquerque, new mexico. we expanded our citygreen environmental education program, and in partner ship with esri, we showcased our work at the national science teachers conference in boston and at a series of university of vermont workshops. our train-the-trainers strategy has led to the enrichment of many more teachers at the math and science innovation center.
