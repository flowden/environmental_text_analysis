 dr. richard “rip” sparks is the director of research at the national great rivers research and education center (ngrrec) located at the confluence of the mississippi, missouri and illinois rivers near st. louis. “like the mississippi, china’s yangtze is a working river that supports the country’s economy. as part of a u.s. science team that visited china, i had the opportunity to share my research on floodplain restoration in illinois with scientists and river managers facing similar challenges balancing commercial uses of the river while maintaining biodiversity. our counterparts were very interested in the work the conservancy and its partners are doing to restore floodplains and reconnect them to the mississippi river. we also shared our experience in monitoring water quality and fish populations in a coordinated way across many different political jurisdictions. ngrrec and the conservancy are now collaborating on the development of an international center that will foster more of these learning exchanges and allow us to use the work we are already doing together here on the mississippi to accelerate freshwater conservation on a global scale.”
