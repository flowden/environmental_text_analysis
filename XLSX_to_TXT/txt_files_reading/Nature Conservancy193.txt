 walter dasheno is the governor of the santa clara pueblo, which lost most of its forest during the devastating 2011 las conchas fire and now has serious flooding after summer rains. the conservancy has contributed to the tribe’s recovery by providing a grant to pay for the engineering study needed to plan for the design and placement of debris catchment structures in the tributaries to the main santa clara creek. these structures will slow the flow of sediment that, along with the floodwaters, is a serious threat to the pueblo’s residents.
