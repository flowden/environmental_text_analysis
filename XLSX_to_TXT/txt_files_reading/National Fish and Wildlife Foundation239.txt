 successful cattle operations depend on healthy rangelands. high-quality grasslands are not just great for cattle — pronghorn, deer, elk, grouse and a wide variety of other wildlife thrive on america’s cattle ranches. nfwf, its funding partners and its grantees all recognize the value of working landscapes, for both wildlife and rural vitality. grants awarded in 2020 helped protect ranches from being broken up and developed, fought the spread of invasive species that increase the risk of wildfire, and modified fencing to reduce the risk of injury to birds and big game living on or moving through ranches. examples of our 2020 grant-making include: in colorado, the rocky mountain bird observatory will use a $200,000 grant to increase rancher enrollment in farm bill conservation programs and improve management of 10,100 acres. in montana, the ranchers stewardship alliance will use a $299,000 grant to offer technical support to ranchers across four counties, improving management on 5,700 acres of grassland habitat and maintaining a high-quality grazing landscape. in nebraska, the sandhills task force will use a $300,000 grant to improve grassland habitat on private land by controlling eastern red cedar infestations and improving grazing systems. in south dakota, the american bird conservancy will use a $189,000 grant to provide conservation technical assistance, develop conservation plans, and assist private landowners in enrolling in farm bill programs.
