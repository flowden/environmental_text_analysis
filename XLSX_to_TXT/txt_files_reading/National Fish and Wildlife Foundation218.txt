 many of our private-sector partners are committed to improving coral reefs, fish stocks and other vital marine natural resources. though many grants support projects unfolding in these environments, much of the work also takes place on land, where sedimentation and other forms of pollution originate. aramco began working with us in 2020 to stop the loss of the world’s coral reef ecosystems. covanta works with us to clean up u.s. waterways and serve as a catalyst for innovation in u.s. commercial fisheries. our partnership with pūlama lāna‘i supports watershed-scale strategies to protect and enhance the coral reefs of lanai, hawaii. we work with seaworld parks and entertainment to expand chinook salmon populations and support the endangered population of southern resident killer whales in the pacific northwest. transre works with us to support efforts to boost the resilience of coastal areas across the nation.
