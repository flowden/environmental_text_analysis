 southern california has the highest population density of the five mediterranean regions. it also has the most land and waters under protectionâ€”a phenomenal achievement considering the extreme development pressure. in the mediterranean habitats of southern california and northwest baja california in mexico, the conservancy is focused on maintaining connectivity among fragmented habitat patches by protecting key private lands that provide linkages and buffers to protected public lands. in the next three years, our goal is to protect an additional 600,000 acres here.
