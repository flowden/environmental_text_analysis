 in southeast asia, we tagged another iconic species: sea turtles. these highly endangered species nest and feed in different countries — and as such are subject to different levels of protections. conservation international and partners were able to track 10 turtles in near-real-time as they meandered around the coral triangle, an area of waters in southeast asia and the western pacific that are home to the highest concentrations of marine life on earth. the information gathered, scientists hope, will open up avenues for conservation partnership across countries. through open-access tools — anyone could follow the tracks of these animals online — we are finding where we need to focus conservation efforts across the seascape.
