 in 2013, edf and our allies achieved a major victory when epa proposed standards to cut pollution from new passenger vehicles, in part by reducing sulfur in gasoline. the standards, called tier 3, will make the next generation of cars cleaner, cutting nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds by 80%. cars also will emit less particulate pollution, a known trigger for asthma attacks, and less carbon monoxide. that’s good news for the 50 million americans who live near high-traffic roadways. children who live in such areas face a higher risk of asthma, cancer and heart disease. edf pushed hard to win the new measures. we testified at public hearings, and our members sent nearly 50,000 comments to epa. fully implemented, the rules will prevent 2,400 premature deaths every year and provide up to $23 billion in annual health benefits, epa estimates. the cost: less than a penny per gallon of gas. the proposed limits are backed by automakers because they harmonize policy across all 50 states—and help pollution control equipment work more efficiently. there will be challenges to securing strong final standards, but with health-care providers and automakers allied with us, we’re confident we will prevail. “this is one of the most cost-effective ways to get cleaner and healthier air while strengthening our domestic auto sector.” united auto workers
