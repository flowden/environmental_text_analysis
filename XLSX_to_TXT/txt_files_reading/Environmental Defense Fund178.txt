 one key to climate progress is to engage growing constituencies, including young people, who care deeply about climate but often don’t vote. in colorado, we enlisted climate-action supporters, targeting millennials (roughly 18 to 33 years of age), asking them to pledge to vote on climate issues. we secured over 125,000 pledges. many previously voted only in presidential elections. “i haven’t been involved in politics before,” says bianca buium, a student at the university of colorado in boulder, “but we can’t just ignore this problem or the politicians will, too.” the campaign, called defend our future, deployed a mix of digital and social media strategies, along with traditional grassroots organizing. our goal is to expand it to a larger, national effort in future election cycles. “millennials are among those who must live with the most serious consequences of climate change,” says dr. alicia kolar prevost, who is running our nonpartisan initiative. we’re also focusing on latino audiences. national polling data shows that latino voters overwhelmingly support action to fight climate change.
