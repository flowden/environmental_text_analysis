 coral reefs repopulate naturally as threats are reduced, but many severely degraded reefs have lost their ability to recover naturally. in 2020, we added a new emphasis on increasing capacity for direct replanting efforts on reefs where the threats have been reduced enough to promote growth. our grantees are establishing nurseries and techniques to increase the survivorship of outplants so that large-scale restoration efforts are possible. restored and enhanced reefs will serve as footholds of biodiversity and sources of brood stock that will help replenish and recover nearby reefs after episodic events. our 2020 grant-making focused on support for the mission iconic reefs effort in the florida keys, which will be the nationâ€™s largest coral reef restoration ever attempted. grant examples include: a grant of $169,000 to the florida aquarium will increase genetic diversity of coral species and develop a nursery stock of urchins, a primary herbivore, to be used in the broader restoration effort in the florida keys. researchers at the university of florida will use a grant of $149,000 to field-test management interventions to address local threats to coral restoration success such as predation from snails in florida. a grant of $100,000 will enable the coral restoration foundation to support active coral restoration at four sites in the florida keys to benefit endangered coral species. project will improve 28 acres of reef habitat through increased coral propagation and direct reef restoration.
