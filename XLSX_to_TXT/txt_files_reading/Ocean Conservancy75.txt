 on california, ocean conservancy was a key driver in the adoption of a new network of science-based marine protected areas (mpas) along the state’s north central coast. since 1999, california’s first-in-the-nation law, known as the marine life protection act, has sought to protect majestic and environmentally significant places all along california’s storied coast. the law calls for a network of underwater parks—marine protected areas— where human uses like fishing are fully or partially prohibited. such prohibitions allow vital ecosystems to thrive as naturally as is possible in today’s world. ocean conservancy played a key role in the creation and passage of the overarching law in 1999, and, in the decade since, in defining and implementing each protected area designated by the law. on the north central coast, ocean conservancy was the leader of an inclusive design process that included a diverse group of coastal stakeholders and we were a voice of thoughtful advocacy throughout more than two years of public meetings needed to finalize the protected areas. since 1999, california’s marine life protection act has guarded the state’s storied coast.
