 our american releaf program completed seven native forest restoration projects in california in 2019, which resulted in 466,910 trees planted across 1,868 acres. we planted jeffrey pines, douglas firs, blister rust-resistant whitebark pines, ponderosa pines, blister rust-resistant sugar pines, incense cedars and giant sequoias. most of these projects focused on post-wildfire recovery—including for the carr, king and camp fires that made national news—and many employed climate-smart restoration strategies. without american forests’ active planting efforts this year and over the past few decades, much of the landscape across the sierra nevada and southern california ranges would convert to shrub fields, which are highly fire-prone and filter less water than conifer forests.
