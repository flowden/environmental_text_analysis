 western water shortages can only be solved cooperatively. in 2017, edf spearheaded a deal that makes more colorado river water available for the environment. under the agreement— the first of its kind—the city of phoenix, the state of arizona, the u.s. bureau of reclamation and the walton family foundation paid $6 million to the gila river indian community in exchange for their leaving 40,000 acre-feet of the tribe’s water allotment in lake mead—equal to 35% of phoenix’s annual consumption. the extra water will slow the lake’s decline and lock in supply for wildlife. it’s a model for cooperative conservation deals throughout the parched west. says gov. stephen roe lewis of the gila river community (pictured): “working with partners like edf, we’re helping preserve the health of the colorado river system.”
