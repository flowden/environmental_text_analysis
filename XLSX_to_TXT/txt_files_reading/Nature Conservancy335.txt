 the federally endangered kirtland’s warbler, north america’s rarest song- bird, breeds only in michigan and winters only in the bahamas. in michigan, the kirtland’s warbler recovery team has fine-tuned the protection of the habitat of nearly all the breeding pairs, but in the bahamas, the habitat needs of the warbler are fairly unknown. the two primary goals of the kirtland’s warbler project, launched by the conservancy in collaboration with the bahamas national trust and the u.s. forest service, are to describe and protect the winter habitat of the kirtland’s warbler and to build conservation capacity in the area by working with recent college of the bahamas graduates. the kirtland’s warbler project works to increase conservation capacity in the bahamas by helping participants develop bird identification skills, expertise in field sampling techniques, and experience with project management.
