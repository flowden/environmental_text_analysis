 engaging agricultural producers and indigenous communities to stem the loss of forests. the conservation of such a vast and globally important resource as the amazon basin requires coordinated strategies that recognize the natural values of forests, the cultural importance of land tenure and the economic realities of agricultural commodities. brazil’s progressive forest code requires amazon landowners to maintain native forest cover on between 50 and 80 percent of their land, but until fairly recently, the requirements were widely ignored. by demonstrating win-win solutions for production and protection in areas where the deforestation threat is greatest, nature conservancy innovation is enabling compliance with the forest code, while increasing economic opportunity. we are also working with indigenous peoples to integrate traditional knowledge with modern approaches to landscape planning in order to enable greater leadership in deciding how their traditional territories will be managed and to have a stronger voice in policy decisions. at the same time, the conservancy is developing a blueprint for the basin of the tapajós river, a major tributary of the amazon, using tailor-made geospatial tools and models to help guide brazilian environmental and natural resource agencies in decisions regarding dams and other development.
