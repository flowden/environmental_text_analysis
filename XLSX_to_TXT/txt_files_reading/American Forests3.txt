 in cities across the united states, demand for trees is on the rise. but without enough people to properly plant and maintain trees, we can’t meet this demand. that’s why, in 2018, american forests launched the tree equity: career pathways initiative. the focus of the initiative is training people in low-income urban neighborhoods (where there are fewer jobs and trees) and placing them in urban forestry jobs. this year, american forests took the program to a new level by awarding grants to five cities: providence, r.i., syracuse, n.y., milwaukee, minneapolis and detroit. the funding, combined with technical resources created by american forests, was used by the cities to make their training programs bigger and better, placing more people in urban forestry jobs. the grants program was a win for people who need jobs. and a win for people who benefit from everything else that trees give us — like shade, clean air and lower utility bills.
