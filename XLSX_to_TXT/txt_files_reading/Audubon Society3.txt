 passion + action = network. that’s been audubon’s story for the past two years—gluing together 465 grassroots chapters, 22 powerhouse state programs, and 47 environmental education centers that serve more than a million people. our flyways vision inspires the four million people we reach, and it makes our mission clear to birders, conservationists, and lawmakers. we’ve tapped people’s passion and translated that into action— on a landscape scale and in our communities. this is a new, robust audubon. it’s one audubon. some doubted that our network would be able to leverage its strengths; others questioned whether we could find a common voice. but while we may not be done, we’re well on our way. consider these facts: in the past year we’ve taken a giant step toward restoring the gulf coast, and our members have planted thousands of bird-friendly native gardens. we’ve partnered with toyota to launch a diverse army of togethergreen fellows in every state, and we’ve helped write the rules that will harness wind energy in the right places while protecting tipping-point bird habitats. i hope you enjoy this report. to start with, we want to share some overarching themes: network action, healthy climate, and the power of key species. please go to audubon.org and let us know what you think.
