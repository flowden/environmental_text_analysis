 greening the global forest market we are all consumers of forests. from our printer paper to magazines to furniture, we are surrounded with the fiber of forests from around the world. but few of us know the origin of these forest products, much less whether they were sustainably managed and legally harvested before making their way into our homes and offices. the forest products trade, estimated at $150 billion a year, is a vast global industry. some of this trade is traffic in wood that was poorly managed and illegally logged, with often devastating consequences for people, wildlife and natural systems. deforestation also contributes almost one-quarter of greenhouse gases causing climate change. in our work beyond protected areas, the nature conservancy promotes the legal and sustainable management and harvest of production forests. our primary tool is forest stewardship council (fsc) certification, in which forest management practices are evaluated by an independent third party according to social, environmental and economic standards. fsc-labeled products allow businesses and consumers to choose those that are “sourced” responsibly. but fsc solid wood and paper represent less than two percent of the u.s. forest products market, and u.s. consumer awareness of fsc is low—two big challenges as we work to build the supply of and demand for fsc-certified products along the length of the supply chain, from forest, to manufacturer, to corporate retailer, to consumer.
