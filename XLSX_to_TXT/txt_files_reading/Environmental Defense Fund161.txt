 wouldn’t it be nice to know where the fish on your plate came from—and that it was caught sustainably? in the gulf of mexico, red snapper and grouper fishermen worked with edf to create gulf wild, a system for verifying the safety, sustainability and location of their catch. at a time when up to a third of the seafood sold in the u.s. is mislabeled, the gulf wild label guarantees authenticity. from gulf under catch shares, fishermen are assigned a percentage of the scientifically determined allowable annual catch. this permits them to fish when weather and market prices are good—and gives them an incentive to conserve, because their shares grow as fish populations recover. to dock fishermen who are part of gulf wild, like buddy guindon, sign a “conservation covenant” that commits them to practices above and beyond federal regulations. this reduces waste. “we’re catching bigger fish,” says guindon, “and our prices at the dock have increased.” to the dinner plate as gulf red snapper stocks rebound, chefs like rick moonen are featuring freshly caught snapper on their menus. more than 1.2 million gulf wild fish have been sold since the program began in 2011. to markets the recovery of the fishery has been so remarkable that the monterey bay aquarium took gulf red snapper off the “avoid” list of its seafood watch guide in 2013. now consumers nationwide can get a steady supply of fresh, sustainably caught fish.
