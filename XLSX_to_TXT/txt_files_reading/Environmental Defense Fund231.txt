 at the port of houston, more than one-third of the air pollution comes from 3,000 “drayage” trucks—diesel-fueled heavy trucks that move shipping containers. many are older models that can be 60 times more polluting than new trucks. now, thanks to a program edf and allies designed, truck owners at the port can obtain grants and low-interest loans to buy cleaner trucks. shippers including lowe’s, target and home depot have agreed to use drayage truckers who track emissions and make the switch to cleaner trucks. our houston program has become a model for other port cities around the country, including baltimore, charleston and philadelphia. this builds on edf’s recent victory requiring oceangoing vessels to use cleaner fuels when near the u.s. coast.
