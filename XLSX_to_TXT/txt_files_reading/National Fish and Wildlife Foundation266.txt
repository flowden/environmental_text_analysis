 nfwf devotes significant resources to conserving marine and coastal habitats while helping to restore the at-risk species that depend on these complex and often fragile ecosystems for their survival. through our marine and coastal keystone, we focus on habitat enhancement, coastal restoration, threat abatement, environmental education, and community-based stewardship. we continually tap into the best minds and science available to achieve these objectives. specifically, nfwf seeks to: increase and sustain key spawning grounds and unique marine habitats; boost populations of select at-risk species, such as whales and sea turtles; and improve and sustain the health of the nationâ€™s major estuaries and the great lakes. together with our partners, we are finding innovative ways to reduce the unintended damage human activity causes in marine and coastal environments, support the effective management of additional marine protected areas, improve tributary water quality, and decrease damage caused by such factors as sedimentation and polluted run-off.
