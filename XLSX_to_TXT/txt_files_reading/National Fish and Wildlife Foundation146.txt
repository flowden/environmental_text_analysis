 nfwf invests in efforts and organizations that move the needle for conservation and generate real-world benefits for wildlife. with a focus on measurable results, nfwf implements landscape-scale programs such as the chesapeake bay stewardship fund, which has awarded grants to more than 1,200 projects that help communities restore polluted rivers and streams. these projects have reduced annual nitrogen and phosphorous pollution by nearly 25 million pounds, contributing to the recent comeback of the bay and its iconic wildlife. the fund represents a partnership between nfwf and the u.s. environmental protection agency, altria group, u.s. department of agricultureâ€™s natural resources conservation service and forest service, csx, national oceanic and atmospheric administration, and u.s. fish and wildlife service.
