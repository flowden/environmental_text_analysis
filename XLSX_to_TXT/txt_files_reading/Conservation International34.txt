 conservation international works to ensure a healthy, productive and joyful planet for everyone on earth—because people need nature to thrive. our approach is simple, yet transformative: protect our natural wealth we identify and protect the spectacular but vulnerable places on land and at sea that are especially important to humanity—the places that provide our food, water and the air we breathe. foster effective governance we engage with governments to ensure that leaders have the knowledge and tools they need to sustainably manage their natural wealth for the long-term well-being of their people. promote sustainable business we work with companies—particularly those that have big global footprints in industries like mining, energy and agriculture—to ensure that the production of vital goods and services continues to flow and supports economic growth without undercutting nature’s ability to support humanity.
