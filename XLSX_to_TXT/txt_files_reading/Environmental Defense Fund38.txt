 the california air resources board approved a new tropical forest standard, a set of stringent criteria for reducing deforestation effectively. if california opens its carbon market to forest credits, tropical states would need to meet the standard to participate. the criteria, developed with help from edf, require that deforestation be reduced over an entire state or province and that indigenous peoples be involved in the programâ€™s design.
