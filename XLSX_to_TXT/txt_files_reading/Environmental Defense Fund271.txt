 the 1976 toxic substances control act (tsca) has never been updated to ensure the safety of chemicals in america. the law is so weak that millions of people now risk being exposed to dangerous chemicals through everyday household products. in fact, companies have only had to test about 3% of 85,000 available chemicals. edf helped found a coalition of health, labor, business and consumer groups working to reform tsca. weâ€™ve also engaged progressive chemical companies. in 2012, a congressional committee took up proposed reform. edf is fighting to ensure the final bill protects public health and the environment.
