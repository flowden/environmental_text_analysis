 the environmental movement has made great strides since the cuyahoga river caught fire nearly 50 years ago. our air is cleaner, our water is safer, and our landscapes are better protected. and yet new threats have emerged that weren’t even on the radar screen when that river blazed. today, more than 1 in 20 americans live within a mile of a fracking site. everyday products like shampoo and children’s toys contain toxic chemicals that interfere with hormone functioning and contribute to cancer. and cities across the nation are being hit by extreme drought, storms, and heat made worse by climate change. people want to know their families are safe and their communities will thrive. i am so proud to be a part of an institution that makes that possible. nrdc protects people’s health and unleashes innovation. in the past year alone, we secured stronger protections against smog. we created the community fracking defense project to empower towns and local governments to protect themselves from reckless fracking. and we designed energy efficiency standards for appliances that will save consumers billions of dollars a year. these and countless other nrdc victories will improve people’s lives and protect the natural systems we depend upon. we can do this because nrdc has the best staff in the business. our experts provide policy solutions and uncompromising science. they are also uncommonly tenacious: they take on big polluters and fight until they prevail. these traits allow nrdc to create healthier, more livable communities for all.
