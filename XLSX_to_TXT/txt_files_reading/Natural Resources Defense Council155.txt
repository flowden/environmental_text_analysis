 the majority of nrdc’s purchases consist of building supplies, office supplies, and cleaning materials. nrdc has adopted the living building challenge’s red list, and from this point forward, all new builds will exclude all the harmful materials on the red list. up until this point, we have used the leed commercial interiors standard for low-voc and sustainably sourced materials. we also meet or exceed leed ebom standards for cleaning materials. we seek to maximize recycled materials in office supplies, and all of our paper is fsc-certified and 100% recycled (we use 30% recycled paper for 11 x 17). in fy2014, we will seek to further green our office supply procurement.
