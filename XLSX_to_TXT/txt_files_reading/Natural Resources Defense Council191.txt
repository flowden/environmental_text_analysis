 how do we know that america can shift to clean energy and still keep the lights burning? we know because nrdc does the analysis to prove it. our experts understand the industry’s challenges and limitations, as well as its promise, and we are unparalleled in our advocacy before the nation’s policy makers. in the waning hours of the last congress, nrdc helped push through an extension of key incentives for wind and solar power. these incentives, known as treasury grants, are especially critical in the absence of a federal renewable energy standard, which we continue to pursue. nrdc also achieved a truly groundbreaking level of collaboration between western land and wildlife communities and the solar industry. when six “fast track” large scale solar projects were proposed on federal lands, we worked with industry to develop siting principles and mitigation measures and won support or neutrality for four of the six projects. also working with allies, nrdc contributed to two crucial victories in 2010 for the cape wind offshore wind project, proposed for federal waters in nantucket sound, which will produce enough clean renewable power to meet 75 percent of cape cod’s electricity demand.
