 the oceans are the natural environment for millions of species in an intricate weave of a complexity we may only just have begun to grasp. but human activities, such as overfishing, insensitive coastal development, pollution, and climate change are threatening the health of the seas and the long-term survival of coastal communities across the entire globe. take kiunga marine national reserve in kenya, for example. despite its protected status, kiunga is suffering from overfishing and the illegal capture of turtles, dugongs, and dolphins, as well as coastal erosion and damage to its mangrove forests and coral reefs. these natural resources are vital to the local communities as well as to the national economy in terms of employment, food, and tourism. wwf and its partners in the region are looking for ways of using the resources sustainably – to sustain human life without depleting the resource base – and safeguarding the area’s exceptional marine life for future generations. wwf’s endangered seas programme aims to stop overfishing and establish networks of well-managed marine protected areas to cover at least 10 per cent of the world’s oceans. by encouraging businesses and industry to adopt practices which are both profitable and good for the marine environment, by changing legislation and showing leadership, and by applying pressure when appropriate, wwf is helping to restore the balance in the use of oceans and coasts.
