 the water crisis in flint, mi, may have shocked the nation, but it is not an isolated incident. nationwide, hundreds of thousands of children have too much lead in their blood, putting them at risk for behavioral and learning problems and reduced iqs. drinking water is the second-largest source of lead exposure, after paint. an estimated six to ten million american homes still rely on lead service lines connecting them to water mains. “in these homes, any time you take a drink, the water could have high levels of lead,” says tom neltner, edf chemicals policy director. “since you can’t see, smell or taste lead in water, you don’t know when the water is unsafe.” edf is pushing for an overhaul of epa’s lead in drinking water rule, first issued in 1991. the revised rule should require a full inventory of existing lead service lines and steady progress toward removing them. we are also working with regional groups like the healthy homes coalition of western michigan to encourage full replacement of lead service lines to homes.
