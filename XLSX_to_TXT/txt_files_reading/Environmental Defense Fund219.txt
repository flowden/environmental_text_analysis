 the london-based children’s investment fund foundation (ciff) is dedicated to improving the lives of impoverished children in developing countries. since climate change disproportionately affects these children, the foundation is helping reduce carbon emissions. “the decisions taken in china over the next five years are perhaps the most important in the world on this issue,” says ciff’s climate executive director kate hampton. “carbon pricing is a musthave. it’s the most cost-effective signal to investors to fund low-carbon activities.” that’s one reason ciff decided to partner with edf to develop carbon trading pilots in china. “edf has a strong reputation in emissions trading, through its work on sulfur dioxide markets in the united states and china. you can’t replicate that starting from scratch,” says hampton. “we seek the right combination of experience in an organization. it must be both nimble and focused so it can be efficient and relentless in pursuit of a goal. we’re very happy to have edf as our partner.”
