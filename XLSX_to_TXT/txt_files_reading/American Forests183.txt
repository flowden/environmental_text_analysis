 the touch america project brings the public and private sectors together to improve our nation's natural resources while providing educational opportunities and job skills training to youth. more than 30 national private organizations and federal agencies work together in the national tap partnership. individual tap projects are planned at the local level with the help of agencies, businesses, and organizations that form local tap partnerships. begun in 1983 as a pilot program, tap has now involved nearly 10,000 youth in learning about americaâ€™s natural and cultural resources. examples of successful taps in 1984 include the collection of red oak acorns in huron national forest, michigan; cedar plantings near crater lake, oregon by boy scouts; the construction of a self guided tour trail in warwoman dell recreation area, georgia; and the excavation of a prehistoric native american site on the willamette national forest in oregon. in late 1984, tap received its first corporate contribution, from the atlantic richfield company. the $1,000 donation is earmarked for use in tap programs in los angeles and alaska. more corporate partners will be sought in 1985.
