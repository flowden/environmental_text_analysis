 to much media fanfare in 1990, the conservancy made the largest single acquisition in conservation history when it purchased the 500-square-mile gray ranch in new mexico’s “boot-heel.” the region is a storied landscape, where the rocky mountains collide with mexico’s sierra san luis range and jaguar pathways coexist with wild bison herds. to the surprise of ranchers and environmentalists alike, the conservancy transferred the property with a conservation easement to the local animas foundation, established to protect the region’s ranching culture and economy. inspired by this, neighboring ranchers formed the science-based malpai borderlands group, which formed a conservation-managed area of over 1 million acres and created innovations such as grassbanking and prescribed burns across ownership boundaries. mexican ranchers as well as visitors from tanzania, mongolia, indonesia and the united states have visited the malpai to discuss how to protect traditional ways of life in the face of modern challenges. now known by its original name, the diamond a ranch has seeded major advances in community-based conservation throughout the globe.
