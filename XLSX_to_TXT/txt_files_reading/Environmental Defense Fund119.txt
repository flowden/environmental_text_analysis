 in 2016, edf helped score important wins to cut u.s. climate pollution, including methane rules for the oil and gas sector, greenhouse gas standards for heavy trucks and a california law to further reduce emissions. in coalition with the american lung association, faith organizations, the u.s. conference of mayors and others, we went to court to defend epaâ€™s clean power plan, which would set national limits on carbon pollution from power plants and reduce unhealthful soot and smog. many states and electric utilities have affirmed they can meet the new standards and are already making clean energy investments. companies like general mills, tesla and walmart have shown we can address climate while growing jobs and competing globally. in 2017, we face a challenging landscape at the federal level and will work vigorously on every front to defend these gains.
