 edf is providing practical, science-based advice to governments and partnering with fishermen to help make sustainable fishing the norm in countries that account for more than three-fifths of the global catch. reforms at this scale could tip the entire global fishing economy toward sustainable fishing. seven countries, shown in dark blue, already have transformed their policies and practices to sustainable fishing. edf is focusing on 12 additional governments, shown in bright blue and representing 62% of the catch. many partners with essential local expertise, such as the wildlife conservation society, are helping bring about reforms in these areas.
