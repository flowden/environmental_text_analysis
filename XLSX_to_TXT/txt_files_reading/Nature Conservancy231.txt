 self-funding freshwater projects provide clean drinking water to urban centers and protect large watersheds in a model of ecosystem services protection that can be replicated around the world. the conservancy pioneered the first water fund in quito, ecuador, to protect a 5.4-million-acre mosaic of public protected areas, farms, ranches and indigenous territories. this watershed captures, holds and fi lters 80 percent of the fresh water that supplies quito’s 2 million people. water users — hydropower plants, brewing companies and municipal agencies that provide water to the public — contribute to the fund, which is then used for conservation efforts upstream that maintain water quality and limit the need for far more costly industrial water treatment. in quito, a relatively small investment of $21,000 by the quito water authority and the conservancy led to the establishment of a $7.5 million endowment that produces around $600,000 each year for conservation projects in the watershed. the people who live and work in the watershed are seeing quality-of- life benefits as they reforest and enhance the ecosystems in which they live. the fund is also enabling local people to start small businesses, reducing the need to deforest for farms and pasture. the ultimate success of the project is reflected in the fact that more than a dozen additional urban centers across south america are adopting the water fund model, positively affecting the health of another 2.3 million acres of forest and grassland for people and wildlife. also on the horizon are plans to expand the water funds to become truly global.
