 cultivation as a conservation tool. our forests, grasslands, rivers and oceans feed the planetâ€™s multitudes, but unsustainable forestry, farming and fishing practices take a toll on our lands and waters. the conservancy supports sustainable harvest strategies that acknowledge the needs of people and the conservation of natural processes we work in some of the most species-rich habitats in the world to help communities develop ecologically compatible livelihoods. in brazil, where the once-prolific atlantic forest is down to less than seven percent of its original range, women are forming medicinal herb co-ops rather than selling their land to soybean industries. along the gulf of mexico in texas, where coastal prairies have all but disappeared, farmers are raising rice while preserving habitat for migratory birds. and in panama, where tropical forests are threatened by the creep of development, conservancy partners are helping small-scale farmers green their practices, keep their land and earn more in the marketplace. sustainable harvests enable farmers, ranchers and landowners to preserve their livelihoods by protecting their natural resources, proving that cultivation and conservation can go hand in hand.
