 science is the foundation for every conservation effort the nature conservancy undertakes, whether itâ€™s developing an ecoregional plan, protecting threatened wildlife or restoring a degraded habitat. drawing on science, we analyze potential conservation sites to identify areas of the highest biodiversity value, assess the threats these habitats face and develop practical, long-term solutions for their protection and stewardship. to better understand and manage places where human interests intersect with wilderness and to measure the results of our conservation work, we also build realistic plans informed by sociology and economics.
