 one of the most important places in the upper midwest is the rugged region known as the “driftless area,” an area of special conservation focus for the american forest foundation. about 40 percent of the region (2.1 million acres) is forested, with 96 percent of these forestlands privately owned. yet many landowners—including a recent influx of absentee owners who visit their land mostly for weekend getaways from the city— are unaware of how important it is to actively manage their woodlands. as a result, there has been a surge of unsustainable development and logging that threatens the future of this iconic landscape. to keep this vital land healthy and productive, aff is helping to lead the driftless forest network, a broad coalition of local and regional partners representing nonprofit organizations, government resource management agencies, and academic institutions. through the coalition we are reaching landowners in new ways to, among other conservation goals, protect songbird habitat and ensure that the driftless area’s oak woodlands continue to thrive and produce income and jobs for local people. we are now working with hundreds of newly engaged landowners, helping them recognize the value of active management. a neighbor-to- neighbor network of volunteers walks the woods with landowners who are just beginning to learn about their land, providing them with the right information and connecting them with professional expertise at the right time.
