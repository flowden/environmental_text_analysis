 over the past two years, wwf and the american hotel and lodging association, with support from the rockefeller foundation, launched a series of food waste reduction pilot projects in hotels across the country. participating properties learned how to sort and measure food waste, how to compost or donate it, and—most important—how to prevent it in the first place. in just 12 weeks, participating hotels saw food waste reductions of at least 10%. the pilot projects, along with additional qualitative research and prototyping experiments, informed the development of a toolkit of food waste prevention strategies for the hospitality industry, and a corresponding online platform— hotel | kitchen (hotelkitchen.org)—that went live in november 2017. the pilot projects are being adopted on a broader scale through a regional industry process in baltimore and portland, oregon, and have been shared with partners in the asia pacific region. we’re also working to share the resources with our partners in the caribbean and brazil.
