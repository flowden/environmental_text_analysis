 when gabon’s president ali bongo set fire to more than 10,000 pounds of confiscated ivory—a stockpile that included 1,293 pieces of rough ivory and 17,730 pieces of worked ivory, all audited by traffic and wwf—he notched a victory for wildlife in africa. gabon is the first country in central africa to publicly destroy its entire ivory stockpile, forever removing it from the specter of illegal sale. “gabon has a policy of zero tolerance for wildlife crime,” president bongo declared. “and we are putting in place the institutions and laws to ensure this policy is enforced.” the ivory burn also marked a milestone for wwf: following a devastating spike in elephant and rhino poaching, wwf launched a global campaign to alert the world, scale up law enforcement and antipoaching efforts, and deliver the policies and funding necessary to effectively fight wildlife crime. this lucrative and illicit industry is estimated to be worth up to $10 billion annually, and it undermines national security and economies in many countries. together, we can secure a renewed focus on the crisis and put a stop to wildlife crime.
