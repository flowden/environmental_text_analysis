 in october 2018, a panel of international experts issued a stark warning: climate change could upend civilization unless humanity takes immediate and drastic action. fortunately, there’s an existing innovation, in development for millions of years, that could help us do it: nature. protecting and restoring tropical forests and mangroves represents at least 30 percent of global action needed to avoid climate catastrophe. as conservation international senior scientist dr. will turner wrote in an op-ed in the respected scientific journal nature last year: “as a climate solution, nature should be a no-brainer.” around the world, conservation international is working to harness the power of nature for climate. and in 2018, we enlisted one of the world’s biggest companies to help us achieve this. apple is working with conservation international and regional partners to conserve a critical area of mangroves in cispatá, colombia. the project will, for the first time, value the full carbon potential of these rich marine ecosystems — from treetops down deep into the soil — and provide a model for other blue carbon initiatives in colombia and around the world. what this means, simply put, is that commitments made to keep the country’s mangrove forests intact will generate carbon credits that can be linked to a growing global market that helps value the enormous carbon storage capacity of these coastal ecosystems. in its first two years, the project aims to reduce emissions by at least 45,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide.
