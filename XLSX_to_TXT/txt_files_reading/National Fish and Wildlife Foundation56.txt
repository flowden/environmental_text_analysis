 2010 was an extraordinary year for the national fish and wildlife foundation. in the wake of the deepwater horizon oil spill, nfwf responded with immediate action to help threatened sea turtles, shore birds and waterfowl. our efforts catalyzed the creation of more than 500,000 acres of habitat for birds and the rescue of more than 25,000 endangered sea turtle eggs — projects that demonstrated the foundation’s ability to bring partners together to achieve positive outcomes. and that’s just one region. nfwf’s work goes on in communities across the country. in new york city, we joined with local residents and corporate volunteers to install the city’s largest municipal green roof. in the pacific northwest, we restored cool, clean streams for spawning salmon, and in california, we worked with solar energy developers to help protect desert wildlife. from maine to florida and in more than two dozen countries abroad, we used the best science to ensure the survival of imperiled species and their habitats. in the wake of the deepwater horizon oil spill, nfwf responded with immediate action to help threatened sea turtles, shore birds and waterfowl. through our relationships with government agencies as well as private entities, the foundation last year funded a total of 417 projects. we leveraged $40 million in federal funds with $139 million in private contributions and grantee matching funds for a total investment of $179 million. increasing the value of our contributions — typically by a margin of three to one — is one of the keys to our effectiveness. the stories on the following pages illustrate the breadth of the foundation’s work and underscore our commitment to finding the best environmental solutions for our planet. with the support of our partners and friends, we’re making investments with impact — projects that will benefit wildlife and their habitats for generations to come.
