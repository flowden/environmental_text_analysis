 climate policy and action as exemplified by california as part of the nature conservancy’s global efforts to affect policy and demonstrate nature-based solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, each u.s. state program is harnessing local knowledge and relationships to increase support for emissions reductions nationwide. to accelerate this work, we are partnering with environmental defense fund to advance clean energy and generate bipartisan support for climate action. building on the momentum of our initial efforts together in new hampshire, ohio, pennsylvania and west virginia, we are now expanding our partnership to additional states and at the national level. california has one of the most advanced state programs on climate, with a multifaceted strategy. working with numerous state agencies, landowners and other nonprofits, the conservancy in california is advancing innovative conservation solutions with successful public policy advocacy to achieve three critical goals: reduce greenhouse gas emissions, remove carbon from the atmosphere, and prepare for and adapt to climate change. california’s establishment of a local forest carbon market, for instance, is inspiring other states and informing similar efforts around the world.
