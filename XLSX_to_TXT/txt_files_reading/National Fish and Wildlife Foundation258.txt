 through its freshwater fish conservation keystone, nfwf—along with a growing legion of partners and grantees—seeks to increase populations of flagship freshwater, anadromous, and diadramous fish species, as well as other aquatic wildlife. dangers continue to mount for america’s fish. many native fish now occupy less than 50% of their historic ranges and are currently restricted to smaller, isolated stretches of streams and rivers. we have lost a significant number of our nation’s fish and aquatic species and nearly 40% of the species that remain are in a state of continual decline—some frighteningly close to extinction. one way nfwf leverages its efforts is by helping implement the goals of the national fish habitat action plan, which seeks to protect healthy aquatic systems and restore those that have become degraded.
