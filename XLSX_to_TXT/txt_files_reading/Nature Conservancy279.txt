 communal lands form the vast frontier of northern kenya, grasslands and savannas that are crucial to the movement of east africa’s iconic wildlife, including elephants, giraffes and endangered grevy’s zebras and black rhinos. tribes native to this region are seminomadic with a long pastoralist tradition. the northern rangelands trust (nrt) helps the people of the region form community conservancies to best manage their land for the benefit of livestock and wildlife. nrt then helps bring resources to fulfill goals determined by the community conservancies, including water projects and community-owned safari lodges, to diversify income, deter poaching and prevent human–wildlife conflicts. the nature conservancy has partnered with nrt to provide scientific and real estate expertise and to train tribal leaders in conservation action planning.
