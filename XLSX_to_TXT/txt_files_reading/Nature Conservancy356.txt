 beginning in the 1980s the conservancy forged valuable relationships with agencies such as the u.s bureau of reclamation to test dam operation changes in the upper colorado river and other rivers, releasing water to mimic natural flow regimes. these experiments proved valuable for fish and fishermen alike, and helped restore streamside forests. building upon decades of work in the region, the conservancy has created a system- wide conservation strategy for the colorado river basin that combines conservation action at 35 sites in seven states with cross-cutting policy and project work addressing issues such as water laws and climate change. these strategies may enable us to conserve 67,000 river miles of the colorado and its tributaries over the next 10 years.
