 in oregon and washington state, salmon, sea birds, eagles and the columbia white-tailed deer were among the species targeted for conservation and restoration with $1.2 million in polluter fines in 2005. the foundation and the u.s. fish and wildlife service selected 14 projects in and around the columbia river estuary for funding in the first round of grant-making through the columbia river estuarine coastal fund. the fund was established in 2004 with fines stemming from the prosecution of three foreign shipping companies charged with illegally discharging oily waste into the pacific ocean near the mouth of the columbia river. among the largest community service payments ever allocated to restoration in the pacific northwest, some of the funds were used to acquire riparian corridors to help restore natural tidal and estuarine functions, while others were used to support a wide range of activities, from habitat restoration to public education and research.
