 a clean energy economy is both achievable and essential—good for jobs, health, and prosperity. it’s not an alternative, it’s the only way forward. there are reasons to be hopeful. in 2014, the world added more clean energy than fossil fuels, a record 100 gw of renewable energy capacity came online, and most americans now report wanting more emphasis on developing solar (79%) and wind (70%) power2 . sustained grassroots pressure on our leadership made it happen. local organizing and national coordination work: it’s why tscf invests in the best collaborations and innovative campaigns in the environmental movement. it’s why we partner with communities that are suffering the brunt of industrial pollution and empower them to help reinvest in clean energy technology and jobs. paid organizers generate 20 times their value in volunteer hours, and we leveraged this capacity with national media, legal, and advocacy work to make more public utility commissions provide the clean energy their customers want. 2014 marked the obama administration’s historic effort to limit pollution from power plants, and we responded by rallying thousands of supporters to give impassioned testimony at public hearings nationwide in support of the environmental protection agency’s clean power plan. we also funded getting more electric vehicles on the road, removing regulatory barriers to properly sited wind projects, and training partners overseas to leapfrog fossil fuels entirely. as we launch our public will-building initiative to put even more muscle behind our 100% clean energy commitment, we are also building the network of funders who understand the issues and give us a sustainable commitment to moving forward.
