 in our effort during 1984 to reposition afa and explain its mission, the board of directors adopted an “operating strategy" for afa. that document states among other things that our association seeks to achieve its conservation education and information mission through active involvement and communication with our members, cooperators and friends, employees and volunteers, and the general public. we will achieve this goal by developing and maintaining a distinctive competence within each of our selected projects, policy initiatives, and programs. we will focus on those issues, opportunities, and markets which provide us the opportunity to produce quality programs with available resources, and to be a national conservation leader and to allocate our resources accordingly. what that’s really saying ls that we will constantly strive for leadership and vision that are grounded in reality. that, to me, ls one of the greatest contributions we can bring to today’s natural resource scene. it is hard to find the balance between public apathy that ignores emerging resource problems and the sensationalism, scare tactics and sloppy science that are sometimes used by those who seek quick and easy ways of influencing public opinion. our commitment at afa is to try and find the best and most responsible balance, with efforts which dare to speak out on important issues, based on a fair hearing of different viewpoints and a careful consideration of the issues, it ls clear that the board, the staff, and the members feel passionately about afa’s conservation mission. seldom have i experienced such a feeling of community and shared goals. their support for an aggressive, yet realistic operating strategy bodes well for the future.
