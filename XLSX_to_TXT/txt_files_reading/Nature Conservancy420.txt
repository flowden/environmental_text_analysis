 why the conservancy works here: millions of acres of virgin forest were destroyed throughout the south due to extensive clearing between the 1880s and mid-1940s. today, less than 10 percent of arkansasâ€™ original forested wetlands remain. who lives here: the big woods is also known as the amazon of north america due to the amazing variety of plants and animals it harbors, including 265 species of birds, 200 black bears and 132 species of fish. what the conservancy is doing: we first began working in the big woods in 1982, and have preserved more than 120,000 acres through our work with partners, acquisitions and conservation easements.
