 the foundation kick-started its grant making in 1985 by supporting the welder wildlife foundation with $32,000 in nonfederal funds. the purpose of the project was to produce a report on the status of the jaguar in south america, central america, mexico and southwestern united states. on march 28, 1972, the u.s. fish and wildlife service designated the jaguar as an endangered species. more than a decade later, in the mid-1980s, the welder wildlife foundation reported that jaguars were safe only in the most remote areas and in parks and reserves, and that development and loss of habitat were expected to continue, along with the decline of the jaguar. historically, there has been little scientific data available for jaguars, including population dynamics, ecology and habitat needs. today, jaguars are still listed as endangered. since the first funded grant project, the foundation has worked to develop a greater understanding of the big cat’s ecology in order to foster scientifically- sound conservation. additionally, the foundation has supported conservation and education projects in response to the socio-economic challenges within the jaguar’s habitats. to date, the foundation has supported seven additional projects with more than $430,000, matched by more than $800,000. these projects have developed techniques to conduct a more accurate census of populations and understanding of the jaguar’s habitat needs. they help ensure land management practices that serve the big cat’s population needs. the jaguar also serves as a flagship species for the conservation of an ecology that benefits other species — such as neotropical migratory birds. the foundation’s support has helped provide the framework for the development of a tri-national conservation strategy for the jaguar in mexico, belize and guatemala.
