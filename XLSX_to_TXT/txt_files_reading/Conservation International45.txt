 in october 2012, conservation international’s warning to “pay now for biodiversity conservation or pay more later” helped to forge a deal at the u.n. convention on biological diversity that would double funding for biodiversity in developing countries from 2012 levels and maintain that funding through the remainder of the decade. the increased funding to developing nations would be used for conservation efforts and to create better lives for people everywhere.
