 brazil consumers got their first taste of “deforestation-free” beef produced by the nature conservancy’s sustainable-ranching initiative, “field to table.” a partnership between the conservancy, the gordon and betty moore foundation, walmart, and food processor and distributor marfrig global foods brought the certified sustainable beef—sourced from a demonstration project in são félix do xingo, brazil— to stores throughout brazil. farms and ranches in this region typically expand by clear-cutting land. by contrast, the conservancy’s project sites in brazil, colombia and mexico are growing by restoring degraded lands and conserving ecologically sensitive lands while increasing productivity. additionally, the conservancy is working with large suppliers and industries to scale up sustainable food security efforts. walmart has committed to monitor deforestation through its entire brazilian supply chain by 2017, and, with strong backing from the latin america conservation council, the conservancy has begun to leverage corporate commitments through industry roundtables. we are a founding member of the brazilian roundtable on sustainable livestock and have helped launch similar organizations in colombia and mexico
