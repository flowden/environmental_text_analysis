 as crowds of jubilant mozambicans watched, their country marked an important milestone: the creation of the lake niassa reserve. the celebration capped years of work on behalf of wwf and many partners—in particular the people and government of mozambique. lake niassa holds over 1,000 species of fish and provides nearly 70 percent of the nearby communities’ protein, along with a major source of local income. for five years, with the support of usaid and the coca-cola company, wwf studied the lake’s biodiversity, ecology and culture. we engaged local communities in order to understand their needs and prepare them to comanage the lakes’ resources. based on those talks, wwf and our partners provided smarter fishing gear and ships for patrolling, and shared community goals with mozambique’s government. with the reserve declaration, lake niassa marks a true turning point for community-approved and government-led conservation—the long-term protection of an irreplaceable freshwater and economic resource.
