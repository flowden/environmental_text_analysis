 the urban forest center helps people appreciate the value of natural resources in their cities and towns. with a grant from henry and jackson foundation we issued the state of the urban forest 2000 report quantifying the benefits of urban forestry. the report estimates that a cross-section of 100 of the nation's urban and suburban forest are providing more than 49 billion dollars annually in clean air and water values. we substantially increase the number of regional ecosystem analyses across the country with support from the us forest service the home depot the turner foundation and others. our analyses have revealed that areas with natural tree cover are losing trees and dryland areas need to plant more trees to compensate for expanded urban growth. we released version 4.0 of our tree cover analysis software city green. the software which maps and measures the values of trees in cities is now easier to use with more powerful capabilities. earth data and earth scan joined sponsors esri and erdas in providing technological support and assistance.
