 in 2008, paragominas was placed on the government’s “blacklist” of top deforesters. to be removed, municipalities had to dramatically reduce deforestation rates and ensure that 80 percent of privately owned lands were properly registered. the conservancy worked with the local government and groups like the farmers and ranchers union to help landowners comply. the effort was such a success, that the municipality was the first to be removed from the blacklist.
