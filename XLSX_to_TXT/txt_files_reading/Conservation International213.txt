 one of the world’s greatest natural treasures, the okavango river, is under threat. the river basin is in near-pristine condition, but plans to exploit the region’s resources could alter water quality and availability, affecting farmers, fishers, iconic wetlands and valuable tourism economies for angola, namibia and botswana. conservation international has teamed up with partners to guarantee the long-term resilience of the okavango basin by promoting the creation of one of the largest wildlife preserves in the world in angola. using the freshwater health index (fhi) — an innovative tool that makes clear connections between an ecosystem and the benefits it provides to people — we will generate a snapshot of the overall health of the okavango river’s headwaters in angola to guide decision-makers on how to sustainably manage the resource. fhi will eventually be used in namibia and botswana. additionally, conservation international is working with partners to identify a “safe development space” for the region that maintains the internationally renowned wildlife and places, while assuring food and economic security for local communities.
