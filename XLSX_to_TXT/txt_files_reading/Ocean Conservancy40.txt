 built the case to protect vital parts of the u.s. arctic from oil and gas development in 2014, ocean conservancy invested time and knowledge in identifying the places most critical to ocean health in the u.s. waters of the chukchi and beaufort seas, where potential oil and gas activity poses an enormous threat. we collaborated closely with partner organizations to pull together the best science on those marine ecosystems, and we sponsored an innovative project by the university of alaska to document and map the infrastructure associated with oil and gas development and commercial transportation in the arctic. we will be using this critical research to press the bureau of ocean energy management (boem) to make informed, responsible decisions through boemâ€™s nationwide offshore oil and gas leasing program that will last from 2017 to 2022.
