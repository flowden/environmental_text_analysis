 in 2019, american forests marked our 20th year working across the northern rockies mountain range. our work there was more critical than ever, given the scale and pace at which these forests are being lost to white pine blister rust and other diseases and pests, as well as extreme fire risks that are due in large part to harmful fire suppression efforts and other activities. climate change is further fueling these rapidly-growing threats. that’s why we planted 36,500 blister rust-resistant whitebark pines in montana’s flathead and custer gallatin national forests—adding to the half a million whitebark pines we’ve planted across north america since 1999. the forest ecosystems of the northern rockies are an ecological treasure, supporting iconic wildlife like the threatened grizzly bear. when we protect and restore this landscape and others, we are caring for our country’s rarest natural treasures, and the wildlife that inhabit them.
