 a new wave of environmental innovation is bringing fishing into the information age. through our smart boat initiative, edf and partners have launched a range of high-tech pilot projects — from the united states to mexico and indonesia — to test cameras, machine learning and low-cost sensors to monitor fishing more accurately and improve sustainability. “just as smartphones transformed global communications, smart boats can revolutionize fishing worldwide, by giving us a better understanding of the state of ocean ecosystems and our ability to rebuild struggling fisheries,” says shems jud, who leads our work in the pacific region. on the west coast, where fishery reforms championed by edf helped bring pacific groundfish — including iconic sole and rockfish species — back from collapse, our pilot with trawl fishermen combines electronic monitoring with artificial intelligence to identify species and estimate weight. our vision: networked boats that share data at sea, enabling fisheries management and business decisions in real time, reducing waste and improving oversight. we’re also working with fishermen in monterey bay, california, where specialized gear could help them avoid catching depleted species while targeting abundant fish stocks, potentially winning them access to previously closed fishing grounds.
