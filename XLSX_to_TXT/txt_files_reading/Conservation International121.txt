 for nearly 20 years, conservation international has worked with starbucks to develop a program to ethically source their coffee. now, starbucks has verified 99 percent of their coffee as ethically sourced — the largest coffee retailer to reach this milestone. starbucks has also launched the one tree for every bag program, which has set out to provide 20 million new coffee trees to farmers to replace old or diseased trees — providing a tree for every bag of coffee sold in participating u.s. stores. this program helps communities while preventing deforestation by enhancing production on existing coffee farms. through its membership in the sustainable coffee challenge, starbucks is leading the coffee industry toward a future that is good for people, good for nature and good for coffee.
