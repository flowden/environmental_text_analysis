 around the world, more than one billion people rely on rainforests for their livelihoods. but rainforest destruction accounts for about 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. edf is working in brazil and mexico to make standing tropical forests— and the carbon they contain—more valuable than logging. our strategy would reward indigenous people for protecting their forest homes, and allow countries that reduce deforestation to sell greenhouse gas reductions in the carbon market. edf brokered a deal in which california, the brazilian state of acre and the mexican state of chiapas agreed to develop guidelines for allowing forest preservation credits into california’s new burgeoning carbon market. “opening california’s carbon market would be a powerful signal to rainforest nations that the world values the climate and ecosystem services they provide.” dr. stephan schwartzman, edf tropical forest director
