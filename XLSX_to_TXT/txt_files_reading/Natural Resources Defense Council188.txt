 year in and year out, nrdc strives to maintain an institutional vision that is both made for the times and flexible enough to allow us to respond quickly to changing local and global forces. we take risks when opportunities arise, and when necessary, we re-examined our strategies. the result is a revised strategic plan for the next five years that will position us to excel in todayâ€™s political and economic climate and achieve our long-term goal of building a cleaner, more ecologically and economically sustainable future. we have named six institutional policy priorities to advance these goals: establish a clean energy future that curbs climate change, revive our oceans, defend endangered wild places and wildlife, protect our health by preventing pollution, ensure safe and sufficient water, and foster sustainable communities. we have made important progress in these areas over the past five years, but we must continue to hone our effectiveness across these fields to influence not only the decision- makers, but those who influence them.
