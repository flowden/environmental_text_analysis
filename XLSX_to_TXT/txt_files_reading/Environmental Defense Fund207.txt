 cleta felzien does not consider herself part of the new energy revolution. but on her ranch in colorado, in addition to cows, a well-used tractor and a faded pink and white house, seven brand-new ge wind turbines spin lazily in the high plains breeze. “that wind is putting my son through college,” says felzien. buying felzien’s wind power is minneapolis-based xcel energy, one of the utilities edf is helping guide into the new energy economy. since 2005, xcel has reduced its carbon emissions by 18%. america’s transition to clean energy is accelerating—more than half of new u.s. power capacity last year came from wind and solar. that trend will continue, thanks to the climate action plan announced by president obama in 2013, an ambitious effort to establish u.s. leadership in the fight against global warming. the plan’s centerpiece: tough standards to slash carbon dioxide emissions from america’s new and existing power plants. when implemented, the standards will represent a major victory for edf and its allies in the struggle to slow global warming. this battle isn’t over, but 2013 will be remembered as the year when the united states got serious about its largest source of carbon pollution—600 coal-fired power plants, 40% of the problem. the u.s. has never limited carbon pollution from power plants. that’s finally changing.
