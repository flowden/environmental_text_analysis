 bears ears national monument, in southeastern utah, protects 1.3 million acres of striking american landscape—and important artifacts that represent the country’s earliest history. the vast, awe-inspiring red-rock country has provided for indigenous groups for millennia. but the trump administration has moved to illegally revoke this cultural treasure, replacing it with two token designations that leave more than 85 percent of the landscape unprotected. in response, nrdc and other groups have filed lawsuits against the trump administration, as have the indigenous tribes that originally proposed the bears ears national monument. together—and with the support of the 225,000 americans who originally petitioned for the monument’s creation—we aim to ensure their ancestral land remains in tact.
