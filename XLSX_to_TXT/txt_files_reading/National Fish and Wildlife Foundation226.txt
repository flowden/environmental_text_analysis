 though many of our public-private partnerships help improve water quality through a range of conservation activities, some federal partners are particularly focused on those opportunities. the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) supports projects to improve water quality and advance community-based watershed restoration throughout the nation. the bureau of reclamation and bonneville power administration both support our large-scale water conservation programs focused on watersheds within the pacific northwest, desert southwest, northern great plains and elsewhere.
