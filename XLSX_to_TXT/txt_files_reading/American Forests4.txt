 this summer laid bare the toll the climate crisis is taking on the united states. death valley sweltered under earth’s hottest recorded temperature — 130 degrees — while unprecedented wildfires engulfed millions of acres in the west. urgent measures are needed to restore resilient forests that can better withstand the “new abnormal,” and american forests is stepping up to the challenge. this spring, american forests planted 11,000 seedlings in burned forests near paradise, calif., where the state’s deadliest wildfire raged in 2018. this planting was part of a pilot trial for a range of climate-smart reforestation techniques. and in texas, american forests planted 70,000 thornforest tree seedlings on 70 acres of former farmland in the lower rio grande valley national wildlife refuge. this project is the first to use our drought resilience strategy, which aims to grow native forests adapted to the area’s increasingly dry climate.
