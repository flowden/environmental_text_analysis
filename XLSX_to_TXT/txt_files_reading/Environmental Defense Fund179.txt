 today’s smartphones are light years ahead of the computers that took us to the moon in 1969—yet our electric power system is on a par with antiquated rotary phones. a big challenge is the u.s. energy system’s built-in disincentives to conserve: utilities profit by selling more electricity and building power plants. a tangle of rules impedes innovation. edf’s clean energy program envisions a low-carbon world where homes generate and sell renewable energy and utilities profit by saving customers energy and money. we’re putting incentives in place to make this happen. edf works in nine states that make up half the u.s. electricity market. in new york, we’re helping governor andrew cuomo make the empire state a model for a resilient energy system. in california, governor jerry brown signed into law an edf-sponsored bill for demand response, which gives people a financial reward for using less power during times of peak demand. in texas, we’re part of pecan street, a living lab for clean energy solutions. as utilities prepare to invest $2 trillion to replace aging infrastructure in the next two decades, edf is ensuring the money goes to a clean energy future.
