 cathleen kelly is director of united states climate policy for the conservancy. to reduce this threat is the most powerful tool we have to both achieve emission reductions and generate new sources of funding for conservation. “climate change, in many ways, is the defining issue of our era. it’s something i’ve been working on for almost 15 years now, and momentum is growing to really take significant action to address this threat. tackling climate change is something i’m very passionate about and feel very committed to. “climate change is going to impact every investment the conservancy has ever made or will make, so we’re compelled to do something about it. supporting policy “we are already seeing climate change impacts to people and places, and we’re going to continue to see more. but if we can pass strong climate legislation in the united states, this would set the stage for a new interna- tional climate agreement that all major emitters can join. then we can really start bending that global emissions curve downward. i’m definitely concerned about climate change, but hopeful that if we take immediate actions to reduce emissions, we can avoid some of the worst impacts.”
