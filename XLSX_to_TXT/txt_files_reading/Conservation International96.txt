 my planet is changing. my ice caps are melting. my rivers are drying up. my islands are disappearing. and my storms are making conditions for life more difficult. i can adapt to this, of course. evolving is what i do best — but i fear for your future. humans are the greatest disruptors to life on earth. your ambition has driven you to build vast cities, to invent ways to get more from less. i have been here for you, but now you are outpacing me. i can no longer replenish what you take. there is more you need to do. i am the source of the food you eat, the water you drink, the weather that shapes your daily realities. if you will not protect me, i cannot protect you. i need you to listen — before it is too late. you need me.
