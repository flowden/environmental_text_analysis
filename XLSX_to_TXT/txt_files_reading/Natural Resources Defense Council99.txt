 all across the country, nrdc works with communities to fulfill our responsibility to leave future generations a livable world. from the farmworkers of california’s central valley breathing in toxic pesticides daily to the residents of new york’s south bronx surrounded by waste transfer stations, the american people too often find themselves impacted by unhealthful policy decisions made on behalf of polluter profits. but these communities on the front lines of environmental and health crises are not helpless victims. they are essential to the solutions.
