 the garcia river forest near mendo- cino became one of the first forests to be certified as a source of carbon credits by the most rigorous set of standards worldwide. the nature conservancy, as easement holder, and the conservation fund, as owner of the nearly 24,000 acres of redwoods and douglas firs, teamed up to establish and manage this demonstration site for the rapidly developing domestic carbon market. over the past decade, the conservancy has emerged as a global leader in devel- oping such demonstration projects from bolivia to china and belize.
