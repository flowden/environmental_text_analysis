 it is estimated that only about one-tenth of the 15 million species thought to live on earth has been described. for each beetle, mollusc, or fungus identified, there are at least ten yet to be discovered. each of these myriad plants and animals plays a vital part in the intricate web of life on our planet. in geological terms extinction is normal. what is not are the current high rates. the loss of any species is especially tragic when due to human activities that could have been averted. scientists estimate that about 7 per cent of the approximately 50,000 vertebrate species (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish) are threatened with extinction over the next 20 years, including a staggering 24 per cent of all mammals and 12 per cent of all birds. in order to maximize its impact and inspire people to support nature conservation, wwf has chosen to focus its efforts on a small number of well-known, charismatic species. these include giant pandas, tigers, elephants, rhinos, great apes, marine turtles, and whales. over the next few years, wwf will work with its many partners to secure the long-term survival of these key species. successful conservation of these animals and their habitats will also benefit the thousands of lesser known plants and animals with which they co-exist and are interdependent. there are many factors threatening species, including habitat loss, overhunting, invasive alien species, pollution, climate change, and unintentional by-catch. wwf’s species programme has chosen to focus on habitat loss and wildlife trade.”
