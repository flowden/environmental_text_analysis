 in one of the most promising conservation projects in the developing world, the conservancy is bringing nearly 60 years of scientific and management expertise to local partners in kenya to preserve key wildlife corridors that link established protected areas and maintain a pastoral way of life. the conservancy has employed its real estate acumen to enable the lewa wildlife conservancy to secure a 62,000-acre wildlife refuge that supports more than 440 species of birds and more than 70 different mammals. north of lewa, the conservancy has partnered with the northern rangelands trust to help empower indigenous communities to better manage their own lands, protect migration corridors for wildlife and improve livelihoods for people. conservancy scientists are sharing knowledge with tribal elders and managers of 17 community conservancies to apply proven conservation strategies across nearly 2 million acres of land. the work of lewa and the northern rangelands trust has demonstrated to surrounding communities that wildlife conservation opens doors to diversify and enhance their livelihoods. conservation-funded health clinics serve villagers for the first time. a micro-credit program has funded startup enterprises as income generators for more than 400 local women. innovative water projects have resolved people-wildlife confl icts by providing secure water sources for communities, their livestock and wildlife. and across northern kenya, elephants, rhinoceroses, giraffes and other animals are returning to areas where they had been eliminated in past decades. the northern kenya effort demon- strates the conservancy’s unique ability to become a trusted partner with a range of public and private organizations, to fill in the talent gaps with local conservation groups and apply sound science to maximize conservation’s potential across a vast landscape.
