 in the gulf of mexico, the secure fishing rights program for commercial red snapper, which edf helped design, has been a resounding success. but recreational fishing, which accounts for half the catch, is not part of the program and is poorly managed, leading to overfishing and large discards of fish. edf helped recreational fishermen launch a two-year pilot program for headboats, or large charter boats. the result: 19 boats were able to take twice the number of customers fishing—an additional 60,000 each year—for red snapper and gag grouper. they could also fish year-round under strict catch limits, while those not in the program saw their seasons shortened to just nine days for red snapper in 2014. discarded fish— typically dead or dying—dropped by nearly half, and revenues improved. the new approach could be a model for managing recreational fishing nationwide. edf now supports proposals before the gulf fishery council to expand the approach to the entire gulf for-hire fishing industry, which includes more than 1,000 charter boats.
