 coastal community-based fisheries provide 50 percent of all wild-caught fish globally, and yet these local economic engines have historically been overlooked by major ocean conservation programs. guided by our new global ocean strategy, ci is launching a resilient coastal community fisheries program to expand the reach and impact of our work in these fisheries systems, with the goal of improving governance, building community capacity and aligning market incentives for sustainable harvesting â€” securing the future of these fisheries so they can continue to support food and livelihood security globally.
