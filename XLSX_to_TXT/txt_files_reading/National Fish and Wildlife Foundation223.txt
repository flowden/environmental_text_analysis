 the department of the interiorâ€™s u.s. fish and wildlife service (fws), after which our private foundation was named, remains one of our closest and most active federal partners. fws supports more than 30 of our conservation programs. in 2020, we worked with usfws and private-sector partners to support wildlife across the country, from big-game species in the rocky mountains to seabirds and shorebirds, sea turtles, monarch butterflies, killer whales, salmon, trout, and bat populations being decimated by white-nose syndrome. the bureau of land management also supported many of our conservation programs in 2020, including those benefiting american wildlife species in alaska, northern great plains and northern rockies. we also worked with the colorado department of natural resources, great outdoors colorado and other partners in colorado to launch a new partnership in 2020. called restore colorado, the grant program will improve habitat for mule deer, elk, grassland birds and other wildlife species in that state.
