 a tossed lunch at a high school in los angeles becomes part of a startling statistic: roughly 40% of food in the us ends up spoiled or thrown away every year. to help address this, wwf worked with the environmental research and education foundation and the school nutrition foundation to launch food waste audit programs in secondary schools. these audits aim to help students grasp the connections between their lunch and the natural worldâ€”and help them learn how to reduce their own food waste. and in april, wwf, the american hotel & lodging association, and the rockefeller foundation partnered to launch pilot projects for curtailing food waste in the hotel industry. the projects included food-waste monitoring and creating menus designed to reduce waste. beyond helping participating hotels, findings will inform a toolkit being designed for the hotel industry.
