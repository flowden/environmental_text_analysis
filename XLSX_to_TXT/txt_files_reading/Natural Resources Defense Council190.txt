 for more than 35 years, nrdc has been the undisputed leader in designing efficiency standards, demonstrating time and again that more efficient products save money and cut pollution. in fact, energy efficiency has the potential to reduce the nationâ€™s energy bill by $1.2 trillion over the next decade and create almost a million new jobs. in 2006, only eight states had embarked on the regulatory reform needed to put efficiency on a level playing field with power plants. today, we have persuaded half the states to go down this road. as a result, utility investments in efficiency have more than doubled from $1.9 billion to $5.4 billion. in 2010, we also helped negotiate efficiency agreements that will save comed customers in illinois almost $500 million while avoiding the need for nine coal-fired power plants. in arizona, we worked with local partners to help persuade a bipartisan commission to adopt an efficiency plan that will save consumers $9 billion, transforming the state into a national leader on efficiency. nrdc is especially adept at illustrating the cumulative power of making everyday appliances more efficient. many products are surprising energy hogs. a flat-screen tv, for instance, can consume more electricity than a new refrigerator. nrdc experts knew we could fix that. in 2009 we helped california draft and approve new standards that will cut the power use of new flat-screen tvs by as much as 50 percent and save californians almost $1 billion a year in the form of lower electricity bills.
