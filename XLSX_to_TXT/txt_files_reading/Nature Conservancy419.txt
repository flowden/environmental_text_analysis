 during the last century, the “clearing movement” in southwestern australia had a goal to convert a million acres a year of native bush into farms. this massive land conversion destroyed and fragmented wildlife habitat, isolating plant and animal populations. nevertheless, the region remains one of the most biologically rich in the world, and a new movement is under way to preserve and restore it. the gondwana link combines the efforts of five grassroots australian organizations with support from the nature conservancy and cooperation with business, agriculture and government. the intent is to connect existing national parks and reserves with new private and public conservation lands, creating, one day, an unbroken band of protected bush for more than 620 miles.
