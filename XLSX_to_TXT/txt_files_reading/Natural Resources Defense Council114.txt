 when it comes to efficiency, the golden state is once again leading the way. in october 2015, nrdc's efforts helped ensure the adoption of senate bill 350, a law that will double energy efficiency savings targets, increase renewable energy generation 50 percent by 2030, and put more californians behind the wheels of electric vehicles. another approved measure, assembly bill 802, boosts energy efficiency standards in buildings and helps residents better understand their home energy bills and use.
