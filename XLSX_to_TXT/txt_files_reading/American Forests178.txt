 1984 was a year of transition for afa. after a diligent search, the board of directors appointed nell sampson as executive vice president on july 1. he succeeded rex resler, who retired at mid-year. with the full support of the board and staff, nell led an intense effort to identify ways to revitalize afa’s programs and operations for success in the coming years. as part of its planning for the future, the board renewed afa’s commitment to sustaining the long-term productivity of america's forests for all of the many resources and uses they can provide. l believe this commitment provides a solid foundation for afa's programs and activities in the coming years. at its fall meeting, the board adopted an action program for 1985, which will be afa’s 110th year of conservation service to the nation this action program, drafted by nell sampson and the afa staff, seeks to, "strengthen and expand afa’s membership and financial base, provide new programs and services, especially information services, to afa members, and to increase afa’s contacts and effectiveness with people and groups throughout the country who share a common interest in resource conservation and forests for the future. we are well aware of the need to keep abreast of the constant changes in our society. new demands and a changing population require reinterpretation of old themes scientific discoveries often disprove long-held beliefs. working with our citizen members and other resource professionals and scientists, afa brings valid and up-to-date information to bear on forestry and conservation issues. we are confident that the future ls bright for that kind of service in the public interest. l am pleased with the accomplishments of 1984, and l am impressed with the enthusiasm and optimism expressed by my fellow board members, the staff, and the many many people who comprise the real afa our members.
