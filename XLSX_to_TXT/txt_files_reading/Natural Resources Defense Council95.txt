 congress created the antiquities act in 1906 to give presidents the power to protect places of natural and cultural heritage for future generations. eight republican and eight democratic presidents have used the act to safeguard iconic areas, including the statue of liberty, muir woods, and the grand canyon. yet, in spite of this proud legacy, the trump administration is stripping protections from many of our cherished monuments. why? to hand over millions of acres of american public lands and waters to the mining, development, and fossil fuel industries. but that’s illegal, and nrdc is holding the administration to account—both in the court of public opinion and in the court of law. there’s just too much at stake.
