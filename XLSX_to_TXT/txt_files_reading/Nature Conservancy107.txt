 balancing hydropower with the needs of fish and wildlife. from its headwaters in the tibetan plateau, the yangtze river flows across china and empties into the east china sea near the historic city of shanghai. the river has great cultural significance and has provided food and livelihoods for millions of people who have lived along its shores for centuries. but with china’s rapid development, its rivers, including the yangtze, are seen as a primary source of carbon-neutral electricity. must development come at the expense of fish and wildlife habitat and people’s well-being? the nature conservancy is working with chinese partners on several fronts along the length of the yangtze to safeguard crucial fish habitat, establish water funds that enable urban centers to invest in watershed conservation, and engage the hydropower industry on how dams are planned, designed and operated, in order to protect and restore fish habitat and other environmental values. innovations and relationships built in china will be applied to great rivers around the world.
