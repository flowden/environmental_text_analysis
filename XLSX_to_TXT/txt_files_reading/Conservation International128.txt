 in 2016, ci joined forces with arizona state university (asu) and the massachusetts institute of technology (mit), two of the world’s top innovation and research universities. the asu partnership — among the first of its kind between a large public american university and a u.s.- based international conservation organization — will focus on making agriculture and fisheries sustainable. ci scientists will teach and conduct research with asu professors, while asu students will participate in ci’s field work. the partnership with mit will advance the fight against climate change by bringing together technical solutions with nature-based approaches.
