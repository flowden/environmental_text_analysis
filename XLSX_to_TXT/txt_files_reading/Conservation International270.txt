 when conservation international and starbucks coffee company first joined forces more than a decade ago, it was with the goal of ensuring that coffee is produced sustainably. in 2003, through the coffee and farmer equity (c.a.f.e.) practices for ethical sourcing, that commitment to responsibility was put into action—transforming not only the lives of coffee growers and their communities, but also helping to transform the practices of the burgeoning coffee industry. but that’s just part of the story. those efforts to demonstrate that coffee can be grown in ways that benefit people and the environment alike have grown into one of the first and most notable corporate engagements to address climate change. by supporting the protection of standing forests and the restoration of degraded landscapes through field projects in critical areas in mexico and indonesia, the collaboration took conservation beyond the coffee farm and into the surrounding regions—activating effective strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation. in the mexican state of chiapas, for example, the groundwork laid by ci and starbucks helped to inform a statewide action plan for tackling climate change in 2010—and to convene the parties that will connect the state of california, a market for carbon offsets, with the state of chiapas, which can benefit from its conservation efforts to reduce emissions from forest loss and degradation. led by former governor arnold schwarzenegger, these innovative efforts set a powerful precedent for creating climate change solutions at the state and regional levels.
