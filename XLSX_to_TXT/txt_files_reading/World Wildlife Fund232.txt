 for the first time, half the world’s population lives in cities—urban centers that are generating over 70% of the world’s co2 emissions. to minimize their impact, many forward-thinking cities are now switching to renewable energy. among them: chicago, cleveland and cincinnati. in the past few years, all three cities have made pacesetting changes to the way they secure electricity for their citizens. cleveland and cincinnati now offer 100% renewable electricity packages for many residents and small businesses via procurement of renewable energy credits. chicago has negotiated an energy portfolio that excludes coal-generated electricity and doubles the city’s use of wind power. all three cities achieved their milestones by aggregating the purchasing power of residents, resulting in money savings as well as greener energy sources. all three have undertaken efforts to improve the efficiency of city buildings as well. these successes demonstrate that renewable energy is affordable, reliable and here now. today’s urban environments hold one of the keys to the transition to renewable energy that is necessary for a future in which life on earth can flourish.
