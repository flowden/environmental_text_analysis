 sharks have roamed the oceans for 400 million years, but that ancient lineage does not guarantee a future. today they’re in serious decline, with millions of sharks killed every year. “in the gulf of mexico populations of some large sharks, including tigers and hammerheads, have fallen by as much as 90%,” says dr. douglas rader, edf’s chief oceans scientist. as top predators, sharks play a crucial role in the health of marine ecosystems, keeping them in balance. there’s no easy answer to the crisis, because many sharks are highly migratory. they’re also a source of food in many nations. edf is leading an effort with mote marine laboratory to save sharks in the gulf of mexico—bringing together cuba, mexico and the united states in a tri-national conservation partnership, the first of its kind anywhere in the world. we’re conducting surveys of sharks along cuba’s northwest coast and mexico’s gulf coast. “until now, the scattered research has never been pulled together to build the big picture of gulf sharks,” says pam baker, edf’s gulf director. the collaboration will yield the data necessary to build management programs that significantly reduce the killing of sharks. “if successful, the tri-national program for sharks can be a model for management of other highly migratory species like tuna and swordfish,” says baker.
