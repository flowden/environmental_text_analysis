 at the suggestion of trustee robert redford, nrdc became the nation’s principal environmental adviser to professional sports in 2004, providing in-depth guidance about greener practices that reduce environmental impacts. in an important milestone in 2011, nrdc helped launch the green sports alliance, which now includes nine professional leagues, such as major league baseball, the national football league, the national basketball association, the national hockey league, and major league soccer, as well as more than 50 teams, arenas, and stadiums. the alliance shares information about better practices and opportunities to measure and reduce environmental impacts. nrdc’s valuable sports greening resources have helped many stadium and arena operators realize that going green is smart business, protects public health, and provides many environmental benefits. for example, n the cleveland indians cut their waste in half by expanding recycling and adding composting, saving the club $50,000 annually. n the seattle mariners will now keep 5.1 million pounds of carbon dioxide out of the air and save about $500,000 in utility costs annually. n through investment in energy conservation and following an energy and water audit facilitated by nrdc, the staples center (home to the l.a. lakers, the clippers, the kings, and the sparks) installed a large solar array on its roof, which provides 3 percent of the energy used at the arena, and replaced all 176 urinals with waterless fixtures—saving more than 7 million gallons of water a year and about $30,000 in water costs. to track league-wide environmental progress, nrdc helped establish the first ever environmental data gathering system in professional sports.
