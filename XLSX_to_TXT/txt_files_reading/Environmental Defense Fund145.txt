 the environmental protection agency in 2015 proposed the first national standards to cut methane pollution from oil and gas operations. edf was central to this important progress. methane, the main component of natural gas and a byproduct of oil production, accounts for a quarter of the global warming we’re experiencing today. thanks in part to edf’s leadership, this once-ignored climate issue is now on the map. in 2012, as the shale gas boom accelerated, no one could say exactly how much methane was leaking from the oil and gas supply chain. so edf launched our most ambitious scientific research ever: 16 peer-reviewed field studies involving nearly 100 partners from academia and industry to measure emissions across the entire u.s. natural gas supply chain. to date, two dozen papers have been published based on the research. it is now becoming clear that globally, a 45% cut in methane pollution from oil and gas operations would have the same climate benefit over 20 years as shutting down roughly 1,000 coal-fired power plants. methane emissions are at least 50% higher than previously estimated. the results of edf’s studies have been key to informing state and federal action. but epa’s rules, if adopted, cover only new and modified sources. more action is needed to reach the white house goal to reduce emissions 40–45% by 2025, so we’ll continue the fight. edf worked with industry in colorado to enact tough rules that cover both new and existing sources of methane, showing that strong standards need not cost jobs or production. edf also challenged inventors to design real-time methane detectors, which are now being tested. “the edf studies confirm there are cost-effective technologies that will allow us to reduce methane emissions right now,” says southwestern energy’s mark boling, “and they are playing a key role in driving change in our industry.”
