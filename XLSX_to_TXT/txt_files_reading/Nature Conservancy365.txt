 in indonesia, an estimated 70 percent of timber exports are illegal, costing the country $3.7 billion a year in lost revenue. in 2006, the nature conservancy and others helped timber giant sumalindo achieve fsc certification of the companyâ€™s 670,000-acre forest concession in east kalimantan, on the island of borneo. it is now the largest fsc-certified block in southeast asia. the conservancy also has worked with indonesian stakeholders to develop and field test a new wood legality compliance standard, which enables an independent auditor to verify the legality of an indonesian forest product destined for the export market.
