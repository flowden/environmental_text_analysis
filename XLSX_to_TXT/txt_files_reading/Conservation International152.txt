 africa is home to iconic wildlife and 1 billion people, many of whom depend directly on nature for their livelihoods. conservation international aims to protect africa’s nature for the benefit of people by embedding the value of nature into policies and decisionmaking. to do this, we need a bird’s-eye view of the continent — and that’s where nasa comes in. the u.s. space agency has been a major actor in conservation, with its satellite data providing a critical tool for conservation planning and management. in 2017, ci and nasa teamed up to equip african governments with the information they need to incorporate the value of nature into their economies. with better data, countries in 2018 will be able to make smarter development decisions — and help set africa on a sustainable course.
