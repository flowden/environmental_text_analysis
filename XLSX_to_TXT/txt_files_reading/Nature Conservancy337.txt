 trevor sandwith is the conservancy’s director of policy for protected areas. “the nature conservancy can encourage a particular country to live up to a conservation goal by not just helping them decide what they should be doing, but by assisting them and making it a reality in the field. by working hand in hand with governments, non-governmental organizations and local communities, we can give even little countries the ability to flex their muscles and challenge other countries to do what they are doing. by sharing our technical and policy expertise, we can enable an environment minister to be confident that when she speaks about raising the bar and pushing the boundaries, she knows that she can count on the conservancy as a trusted partner to back that up back home. international agreements can help show some countries what the rest of the world is doing. it’s a way of seeing change happen, and that change will trickle down all the way to local communities. international policy process isn’t just limited to government—it can start with community-based participation. international policy meetings give indigenous and local communities a chance to make their voices heard across the world. that gives the international community a chance to join them in their priorities on the ground.”
