 a sampling of accomplishments for the year showcases diverse efforts to improve health and quality of life by bolstering the role of trees in our urban landscapes. in collaboration with local partners, tnc has embarked on a community greening effort in bridgeport’s east side neighborhood that includes developing green stormwater infrastructure, planting trees, and engaging volunteers in stewardship of parks and other natural areas. the eco-urban assessment model, which informed tnc’s decision to work in the east side, is now being replicated in other cities in connecticut and is guiding the chapter to other neighborhoods in bridgeport.the nature conservancy has teamed up with public school programs and other partners in birmingham to provide urban youth with hands-on experience in environmental science careers that also benefit the environmental health of their cities. in birmingham’s woodlawn neighborhood, students are engaged in restoring vacant lots into green oases that inspire community pride while helping cool the city, clean its air and accommodate recreation. melbourne regularly ranks as one of the world’s most livable cities, but industrial, commercial and residential development accompany such popularity. that’s why retention and growth of bushland and other green areas in melbourne are so important, along with trees’ ability to provide cooling summer shade and healthy, breathable air. the conservancy’s partnership with resilient melbourne includes developing the melbourne metropolitan urban forest strategy to help plan for a greener melbourne. as our first project in this african nation, tnc is working with others to establish a water fund in cape town, a city in the grip of drought. a primary culprit is thirsty, non-native, ornamental plants that are sucking the watershed dry. removal of these invasive species also can be a job creator for underserved urban communities.
