 stewardship of the planet has always resonated with mark heising and liz simons, and they found that their views align with edf’s approach of using science and economics and engaging corporations. “to move the needle on climate today, we need to reduce short-term forcers like methane, in addition to carbon dioxide,” says heising, an edf trustee who co-chairs our climate committee. “we learned edf was looking at the methane problem, and we got in early.” both were impressed by peer-reviewed studies that edf launched with dozens of university researchers to analyze methane leaks. as simons, president of their family foundation and a funder of early childhood initiatives, says: “we want a safe, habitable planet for our children and all the world’s children.”
