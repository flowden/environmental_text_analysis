 nrdc‘s energy team also has the resolve to fight the dirty relics of the past: coal, corn ethanol, fracking, tar sands, and mountaintop mining. nrdc’s midwest energy team won a significant victory in the heart of coal country when american municipal power-ohio (amp) decided to cancel its proposed $4 billion coal plant in southeast ohio. the plant would have emitted 7 million tons of greenhouse gases and more than 10,000 tons of other harmful air pollutants over 40 years. nrdc successfully limited the extension of the main corn ethanol tax credit to one year— saving $25 billion—by helping build a coalition of unusual bedfellows ranging from the tea party’s freedomworks to moveon.org. meanwhile, as potentially hazardous natural gas drilling spreads across the nation, nrdc is calling on congress to close a loophole that exempts chemical-intensive fracking from the safe drinking water act. our washington, d.c. team is deployed in the fight against the destruction of the boreal forest by tar sands strip-mining and drilling, pushing the state department to reject pipelines that would transport tar sands from alberta through sensitive lands and major aquifers to refineries in already- polluted communities of the u.s. gulf coast, and working to block u.s. energy bills that promote tar sands. and with coal companies devouring appalachia with mountaintop removal mining, nrdc reached out to new partners in country music, such as emmylou harris, patty griffin, and big kenny, to speak out against this practice and perform at the “music saves mountains” concert in nashville.
