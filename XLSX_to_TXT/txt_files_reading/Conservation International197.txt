 human survival hinges on the life-sustaining benefits of a healthy ocean. three billion people rely on fish for their primary animal protein source â€” and demand will only continue to rise. meanwhile, climate change is acidifying seawater and warming the ocean, raising sea levels and threatening to displace millions of people in a few short decades. in 2020, conservation international will announce a bold new alliance to address some of the gravest threats to the ocean, from illegal fishing and overfishing to biodiversity loss. the partnership will protect 18 million square kilometers (7 million square miles) of ecologically significant seas. it will replenish fisheries, increase the resilience of marine species and ecosystems to climate change and help vulnerable coastal communities eat, thrive and adapt for generations to come. tapping into growing political will and momentum to protect the ocean, the alliance will provide the expertise, science, funding and community engagement needed to generate ocean conservation and sustainable management at an unprecedented scale.
