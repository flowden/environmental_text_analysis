 members of the pacific islands forum, which endorsed the pacific oceanscape framework in 2010, made historic commitments to ocean conservation in 2012, signaling that their pledge to sustainably manage 40 million square kilometers (15 million square miles) of ocean is gaining traction. as part of these commitments, the cook islands launched a 1.2-million-square-kilometer marine park, the largest of its kind at the time. it was quickly surpassed when new caledonia soon after pledged to create a 1.4-million-square-kilometer marine protected area. both of these initiatives were shaped and supported by conservation international staff.
