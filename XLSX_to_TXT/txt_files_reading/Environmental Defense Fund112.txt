 shoppers want products for their families to be free from hazardous chemicals. edf played a decisive role in helping walmart identify and significantly reduce the use of eight harmful chemicals in the personal care products sold at its u.s. stores. walmart asked its suppliers to phase out the chemicals under a sustainable chemistry policy it developed with edf in 2013. in 2016, walmart reported its suppliers achieved a 95% reduction by weight of the eight chemicals from their products. that amounts to about 23 million pounds of hazardous chemicals removed from everyday products. edf senior manager for consumer health boma brown-west says, “we helped walmart develop key criteria for its policy, including prioritizing the chemicals of highest concern, increasing transparency and advancing safer substitutes.” walmart’s current policy affects about 90,000 items made by 700 manufacturers that are sold in u.s. walmart and sam’s club stores. customers at other retail stores will find the safer products sold there as well.
