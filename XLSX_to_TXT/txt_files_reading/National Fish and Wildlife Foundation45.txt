 one of the most exciting developments in recent years has been the rapid growth of land trusts and conservancies that help private landowners protect and restore wildlife without compromising their work and livelihoods. the foundation has enthusiastically supported expansion of this conservation strategy nationwide. in eastern north carolina, for instance, the foundation provided a $50,000 grant to the conservation fund to help minority and low-income farmers learn about and access financial and technical assistance programs. over 1,200 landowners attended meetings to learn they could increase income and support wildlife recovery on their properties. the program helped secure $8.5 million in income and debt reduction for landowners. the foundation is also investing in efforts to encourage sustainable agricultural practices. thethrough the california sustainable winegrowing alliance, the foundation invested close to $30,000 to support outreach to over 4,000 wine/grape growers, providing demonstrations of vineyard management techniques to enhance wildlife habitat. the program gives growers and vintners educational tools to increase adoption of sustainable practices and to measure and demonstrate ongoing improvement.
