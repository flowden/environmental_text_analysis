 for more than half a century, this program has offered a way for members to see and learn first-hand about the natural resources in our forests. participants have enthusiastically acclaimed the trips as informative and educational, and restorative to spirit as well as body. the program has been expanded over the years from the original two horseback packtrips and now includes other types of trips, such as by canoe, hiking-with-pack- stock, combinations of rafting and horseback, and even by covered wagon. in 1984, 33 trips took horseback riders, hikers, and canoeists into some of the most beautiful backcountry in america. in 1985, 39 trips are planned.
