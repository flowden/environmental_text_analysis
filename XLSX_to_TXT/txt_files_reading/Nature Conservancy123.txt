 of the 60 percent of the world’s population projected to live in cities in the next 15 years, 60 percent of those city dwellers will be under the age of 18. today, the millennial generation, born in the two decades after 1980, represents the largest generation of all time. these young people are growing up more urban, more ethnically and culturally diverse, and more disconnected from nature than any previous generation. in 1995 the nature conservancy started leaders in environmental action for the future (leaf) in new york city to build future generations of conservation leaders by better engaging the youth in our cities in understand- ing and appreciating nature. leaf provides inner-city high school students with paid summer internships at conservancy preserves and in other natural areas, involving more than 1,000 students and 28 states. these youth programs in the united states are made possible with support from home improvement company lowe’s. during their internships, leaf students live and work with mentors who guide them in the ways of nature, teamwork and independent living. one-third of surveyed leaf participants have gone on to pursue environmental careers, and more than 50 percent volunteer for environmental causes in their communities. going forward, we will provide support beyond high school through college scholarships and internships, post-graduation fellowships, and help for gaining entry into the conservation workforce. a related conservancy youth program, nature works hong kong, launched this year (see page 56). as the conservancy’s urban conservation program expands around the world, a shared component will be the cultivation of leaders from those urban centers to ensure that nature has a strong and vibrant voice.
