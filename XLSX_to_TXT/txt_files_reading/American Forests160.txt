 1989 was a milestone year for corporate involvement in environmental issues, especially global releaf. the winery of ernest and julio gallo kicked off a joint effort with afa with a 10 city tour to initiate major tree planting and reforestation efforts in those areas. the cities involved in the project were boston, chicago, grand rapids, los angeles, miami minneapolis, new york, portland, san francisco, and seattle. the e&j gallo winery also pledged to establish the global releaf fund with afa. the fund is available to help communities implement their special projects--projects which go a long way toward realizing afa's goal of 100 million trees by 1992. as part of the support from gallo, in-store displays will be established to inform customers about global releaf and the environmental importance of planting trees.
