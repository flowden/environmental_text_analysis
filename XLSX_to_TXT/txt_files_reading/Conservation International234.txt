 as a founding member of the coral reefs of the high seas coalition, conservation international is using its research to lead a push for protections for reefs in the high seas, a major step forward in ocean conservation. the coalition is focusing its efforts on the high seas surrounding the salas y gómez and nazca ridges, two seamount chains that stretch across 2,900 square kilometers (1,200 square miles) in the southeastern pacific. marine more than half the world’s oceans lie beyond the jurisdiction of any nation. this vast expanse, known as the “high seas,” is home to species unknown to science, many of them in deepwater coral reefs. these reefs are largely unstudied and vulnerable to unsustainable fishing, deep-sea mining and marine pollution. ecosystems in this region have some of the highest levels of endemism on earth — meaning that species found here are found nowhere else. recent explorations in this region have documented the deepest light-dependent coral reefs on earth, as well as numerous species new to science — yet this area remains unprotected. fishing and other commercial activities are still at low levels in this region, so conservation international and partners are seizing a time-sensitive opportunity to protect its unique natural and cultural resources before they are lost forever. and by building the scientific case for high seas protections, we are working to achieve the global target of protecting at least 30 percent of the oceans.
