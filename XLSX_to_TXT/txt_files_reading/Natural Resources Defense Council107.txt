 last year, we welcomed a transformative new leader to the helm of nrdc- rhea suh. at the time, we were still living under the threat that the keystone xl pipeline would bisect our nation, putting families and communities at risk. last year, we hadn't yet se-en the obama administration's plan to limit carbon pollution from power plants. last year, it seemed the nations of the world would never find a path to a global climate agreement. rhea hit the road running, traveling thousands of miles, appealing to thousands of people in the united states and overseas, and leading an invigorated team to a series of successes, keystone, carbon pollution plan, and a global climate agreement? victory or major progress on as fronts-in no small measure due to the dedicated work of nrdc. that's what i call momentum. this isn't just the wind at our hacks; these are the winds of change-and they're bringing us an unprecedented moment of challenge and opportunity. the forces of public pressure and political will came together this year in spectacular fashion, and nrdc is ready to take advantage of the opportunity. in fact, it is the challenge that we want and are ready for. forty years ago, nrdc had just begun building the bedrock protections for our land and water that have au.stained our community ever since, and we're fought hard to protect those gains, this year, we have the chance to build a new baseline for environmental protections, and this organization's skilled legal minds, rock-solid science, impassioned advocacy, and effective communications are going to make the difference. you are, too. your voices, your passion, your commitment are more important than ever for the fights ahead. on behalf oft he board of nrdc, i am grateful that this organization can count on you.
