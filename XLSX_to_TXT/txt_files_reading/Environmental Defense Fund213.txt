 edf climate corps trains graduate school students to find energy savings, then embeds them at businesses and public institutions for a summer. since the program’s inception in 2008, climate corps fellows have identified nearly $1.3 billion in energy savings —enough to power 180,000 homes annually over the lives of the projects. our 400 alumni are rapidly becoming the next generation of green leaders, with 80% of them now working in sustainability at leading companies. many are hired by their host firms. often, the energy fixes they find are surprisingly simple. one fellow at a supermarket chain wondered why some freezer doors had heaters while others had energy efficient anti-fog film. he found an anti-fog product that could be retrofitted to existing doors. that could cut co2 emissions by 26,000 tons a year. while edf climate corps fellows find immediate energy savings, they also focus on goal setting, financing and data management. the goal? to make energy efficiency a corporation-wide activity.
