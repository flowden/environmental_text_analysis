 people often ask us how we remain hopeful in the face of growing environmental threats. it’s a reasonable question. risks to health are on the rise. ecosystems are under assault on land and sea. climate change is hitting home—with crippling heat and drought, savage storms and floods—while we continue to pump carbon into the atmosphere. and yet at edf, we remain optimistic that we can still prevent the worst effects of climate change, protect human health, restore habitats and return oceans to abundance. we’re hopeful because, with our partners, we’ve developed a set of policy tools that have delivered extraordinary results. if we bring them to scale in time, they will do the job. we’re hopeful, too, since more people are joining with us to build these solutions, and since urgency puts pressure on leaders to take action. finally, we’re optimistic because we’re making progress. a mandatory, declining cap on carbon that edf helped design took effect this year in california, and china launched the first of seven pilot carbonreduction programs. president obama rolled out a plan to reduce power plant emissions. walmart, working with edf and others, decided to phase out a number of chemicals of concern in consumer products. we expanded partnerships with farmers to reduce pollution from nitrogen fertilizer. and we saw the commercial red snapper fishery in the gulf of mexico—near collapse in 2007 when edf helped introduce a catch share management program—continue its remarkable recovery. with great need comes great opportunity. thank you for your steadfast support. it makes our work possible.
