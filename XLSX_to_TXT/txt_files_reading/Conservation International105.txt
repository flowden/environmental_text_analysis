 tropical forests make up less than five percent of the earth’s surface, but they support almost half its species. they are essential to humans, too: more than one billion people depend on tropical forests for their livelihoods, and indigenous people are the custodians of much of them. by storing carbon, these forests play a critical role in the planet’s resilience to climate change — research shows that protecting forests can provide 30 percent of global carbon emissions and sequestration goals. deforestation and climate change, however, threaten these critical places. conservation international marked a major achievement in march 2015 for the protection of one of the earth’s last great tropical forests. with support from ci, suriname’s indigenous people declared the south suriname conservation corridor, safeguarding a 72,000-square-kilometer (7,800-squaremile) tract of continuous tropical forest. ci is now working with the government on legal recognition of the corridor. the benefits of this forest are felt far and wide: the area stores roughly 11 gigatons of carbon — about a year’s worth of global carbon emissions — and absorbs more than eight million tons of carbon annually. the corridor also comprises almost all of suriname’s watersheds, which provide 60 percent of the country’s water supply. the forests also provide medicines, food and construction material for suriname’s indigenous people. granman ashongo alalaparu of the trio tribe shares his advice: “protect your area; protect your water; protect your land.” the new corridor, managed by the indigenous groups that live within it, provides economic benefits to suriname — and to the indigenous people themselves, who are taking on jobs as rangers and park guards. it also has potential to generate income for the country as forest carbon markets develop. the paris agreement made it clear: tropical forests represent at least 30 percent of the solution to keep the planet from radically overheating.
