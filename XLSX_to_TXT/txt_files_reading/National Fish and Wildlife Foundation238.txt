 farmers, conservation groups, government agencies and food and beverage companies share many common goals, chief among them clean, abundant water supplies and healthy, productive soils. nobody wants farmers to waste money on fertilizer that washes off their fields into freshwater streams, where excess nutrients degrade habitats and imperil wildlife populations. nfwf invests in projects that drive innovation and produce win-win scenarios for all agricultural stakeholders. many projects supported by nfwf help willing farmers implement no-till cover cropping, invest in new manure injection technologies, restore pocket wetlands to catch runoff, and plant forested buffer zones. examples of our 2020 grant-making include: nfwf awarded a grant of $600,000 to the american farmland trust to offer one-on-one technical assistance to farmers and build holistic soil health management systems on farms in three counties in ohio. a $489,000 grant to the alliance for the chesapeake bay will enable farmers in maryland to establish forested buffers between fields and streams to benefit chesapeake logperch, a small, ray-finned fish that only exists in a relatively small area in the susquehanna river basin. 46 the illinois corn growers association won a $258,000 grant to work field-by-field in parts of illinois and kentucky helping farmers improve efficiency and prevent excess nutrients and sediment from fouling waterways. the vermont land trust will use a $199,000 grant to produce ecological assessments and wetland restoration plans for 12 farmland conservation projects that will prevent excess fertilizer from entering the connecticut river and flowing downstream to long island sound. in michigan, the clinton conservation district will leverage a $183,000 grant to increase farmer participation in federal farm bill programs by working with landowners to create and put into practice conservation management plans.
