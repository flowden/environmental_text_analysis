 if u.s. buildings were a country, they would be the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. nrdc and the institute for market transformation launched the city energy project in early 2014 to help 10 major american cities drastically reduce carbon emissions by boosting energy efficiency in buildings. the groundbreaking initiative has put those cities on track to cut nearly $1 billion in energy costs by 2030, and the project will reach even more cities in the coming years, as it expands from a $10 million to a $20 million effort.
