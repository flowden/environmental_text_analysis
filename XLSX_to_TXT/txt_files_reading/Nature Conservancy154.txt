 more than a decade in the making, restoration of maineâ€™s penobscot river (left) is an unprecedented and innovative effort that has removed two dams and is building a state-of-the-art fish bypass around a third (above), all while making hydropower elsewhere on the river more effi cient. as a result, more than a thousand miles of habitat along the penobscot and its tributaries are being reopened for sea-run fish, with tremendous benefi ts to biological and human communities along the river. the nature conservancy is an active member of the penobscot river restoration trust, taking a leading role on the science team and working to raise public and private funds to acquire and remove the dams. researchers and conservationists consider this project a model for other river restoration efforts around the world. nature.org/ar-penobscot
