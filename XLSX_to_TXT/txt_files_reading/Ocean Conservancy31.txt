 promoted healthy fisheries and resilient fishing communities nationally, overfishing is at an all-time low, in great part thanks to ocean conservancy’s decades-long effort to secure sustainable u.s. fisheries. in april, the national marine fisheries service released its 2014 status of stocks report showing important signs of recovery for ocean ecosystems and fishing communities. part of our advocacy effort involved rallying support for the west coast’s fishery ecosystem plan, resulting in a new effort to move management beyond a focus on single species and to one that considers the health of the whole ecosystem. in addition, in the face of changing ocean conditions, brought on in part by climate change, we are developing a new tool with international experts that considers a broader and more complex set of variables to help fisheries better adapt. together with partners, we are building a state-of-the- art “flight simulator” that will allow fishery managers to better factor ecological, social and economic dynamics into their decision-making and policy development. once completed we plan to apply this tool to fisheries around the world.
