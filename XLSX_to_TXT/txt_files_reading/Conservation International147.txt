 on fishing boats and in processing plants, people were forcibly held — sometimes for decades — with little or no pay. many environmental ngos in the fishing sector wouldn’t touch the problem. ci’s jack kittinger did. urged on by a small group of peers, kittinger assembled a working group to create a framework for social responsibility in the seafood sector. their recommendations, published in june in the prestigious journal science, called on governments, businesses and ngos to take measurable steps to ensure seafood — the world’s most traded food commodity — is sourced without harm to the people involved in producing, processing and distributing it. in 2015, investigative journalists uncovered seafood’s dark secret: that the multibillion-dollar industry was being fueled, at least in part, by slavery. the framework quickly gathered supporters across the sector, and ci helped secure commitments to a shared definition of social responsibility from 25 major seafood businesses. in the next year, we will work with these businesses to implement their commitments, enabling transparency in the often murky seafood supply chain.
