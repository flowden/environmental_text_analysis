 an independent review found that the 400,000+ hectare central cardamom protected forest —an area conservation international has worked to protect—has the lowest deforestation rate compared to surrounding forests in the northern cardamom region, despite the enormous and increasing pressures it faces. the review team talked to partners, donors, government and local experts; visited the forest; and used satellite imagery analysis to measure deforestation. the imagery analysis showed that just 2 percent of the total program area has lost vegetation in the past six years, compared to 15 percent of the assessed buffer zone in that same period.
