 a police official keeps watch over ivory confiscated from smugglers in china in march 2016. in september of that same year, the international union for conservation of nature reported a severe drop in africa’s elephant population over the past decade, largely from poaching. but new commitments from the us and china offer reason for hope. in july 2016, the us banned most trade of elephant ivory. china followed suit in december, announcing plans to close its domestic ivory trade by the end of 2017. wwf, meanwhile, has developed innovative technologies to protect wildlife from poaching—including a thermal infrared camera (made by the company flir) that detects body heat from afar, even at night. since the camera’s introduction in kenya in spring 2016, it has helped rangers catch over 100 poachers in the maasai mara national reserve.
