 it weighs less than a dollar bill, can fly 2,500 miles, and depends for its survival on a single plant. the monarch butterfly—whose annual migration spans the continent—has captured america’s heart. but it needs our help. so, edf is working to save this miraculous creature. in the past 20 years, the monarch butterfly population has plummeted 90 percent, and it could face an endangered species listing in 2019. edf has assembled an extraordinary alliance of farmers, academics, corporations and states dedicated to ensuring the monarch’s survival. “our goal is to restore 1.5 million acres where milkweed, the monarch caterpillar’s sole source of food, can flourish,” says edf’s david wolfe (pictured left). we’re working with landowners in texas and in california, where we also helped pass a bill that will fund protection of critical overwintering and breeding habitat. and in missouri, we’ve launched a flagship project with smithfield foods to restore 200,000 acres of native prairie. that work will also help pollinators such as bees and birds, foster carbon absorption in the soil, promote clean water, and provide renewable energy fuel when the grasses are harvested after the butterfly has passed through.
