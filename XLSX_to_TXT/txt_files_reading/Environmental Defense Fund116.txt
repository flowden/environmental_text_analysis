 the road to stabilizing the world’s climate leads through china, the world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter. twenty-five years ago, beijing called on dr. daniel dudek, now edf’s vp for asia, to participate in the country’s first pilot projects with economic incentives for pollution control. recently, edf provided technical assistance as china launched seven carbon-trading programs. that set the stage for beijing to roll out a national carbon-trading program, the world’s largest, in 2017. “edf’s goal is to help china develop infrastructure and policies needed to shift the economy toward a low-carbon future,” says dr. zhang jianyu, our china managing director. the transition is being implemented by a new generation of enforcement officers, 34,000 of them trained through a program edf established with leading universities. and since much of china’s pollution comes from factories that export goods, we began a green supply chain initiative that uses the purchasing power of the government and multinationals to improve energy efficiency.
