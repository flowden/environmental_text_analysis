 conservation of the forest habitat in the yucatán peninsula is not just about ensuring the viability of vulnerable species such as mahogany and jaguar— it’s also about working with the communities who live in the forests. the conservancy is supporting sustainable forestry projects by strengthening business capacity, providing technical advice, and giving seed money to finance a transition to more ecologically sound forest harvest techniques. the conservancy works with two local organizations on sustainable forestry work in the region: tropica rural latinoamericana spearheads work in the calakmul biosphere reserve and east into southern quintana roo, and the organization of forestry ejidos (oepf) works in the maya region as far north as the sian ka’an biosphere reserve. oepf’s sustainable forestry project has been so successful that it won second prize in the international schooner contest for projects that alleviate poverty and improve conservation.
