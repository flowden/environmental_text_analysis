 while we continue to publish our award-winning american forests magazine, we also expanded our electronic communications through forestbytes, our regular enewsletter. in addition, we updated and refreshed our website to enhance visitor experience and engagement via the worldwide web. media coverage increased for several of our programs, especially the national register of big trees, our urban ecosystem assessments, and our global releaf action and education campaign. our forest policy center’s work on the hot-button issues of energy conservation and wildfire also received press attention, as did our national conference on urban ecosystems. last but by no means least, american forests achieved the highest rating (4 stars) from the charity watchdog charity navigator. we were also listed as a top 10 environmental charity by the american institute of philanthropy’s charity watch, and maintained our member ship in the bbb’s wise giving alliance.
