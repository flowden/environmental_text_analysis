 in washington, the administration’s destructive environmental agenda is in full swing. but edf’s deep bench of attorneys is working to stop the onslaught. with epa’s leadership operating in secrecy, edf filed a freedom of information act request to see epa administrator scott pruitt’s schedule. pruitt finally released the schedule in september, revealing that he met regularly with executives from mining, fossil fuel and auto industries, sometimes shortly before making decisions that put their interests above those of the american people. in june, pruitt suspended methane standards for new and modified oil and gas facilities, dealing a severe blow to climate action. edf, together with other health and environmental groups, filed suit, requesting an emergency stay to block the decision. a federal appeals court struck down pruitt’s decision and the standards are now in full effect nationwide. then, when pruitt sought to suspend implementation of tighter limits on ground-level ozone, or smog, edf and 16 state attorneys general sued—and pruitt reversed course. unfortunately, some 115 million americans still breathe air with unhealthy levels of smog. edf and allies successfully challenged efforts by the department of the interior to suspend vital methane standards on oil and gas facilities on public and tribal lands. we also defended the right of states to pursue clean energy. three victories over industry challenges in new york, connecticut and illinois have kept clean energy efforts there on track. “epa has undergone the government equivalent of a hostile takeover,” says our general counsel vickie patton. “but edf has shown that it can fight and win.”
