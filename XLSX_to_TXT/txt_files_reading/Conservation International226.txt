 poaching on the rise after the pandemic hit, conservation international field offices went on alert, carefully following the situation in our project sites around the world. what they found: poaching and deforestation increased after covid-19 restrictions went into effect, with bushmeat and ivory poaching incidents becoming more frequent in africa, while amazonian deforestation in brazil reached a nineyear high. evidence suggests that the majority of these activities were enabled by weakened enforcement efforts that people exploited — some driven by desperation, others by profit. in the early days of lockdowns, the idea that nature was “getting a break” was quickly disproven, as conservation international researchers uncovered. protected areas in peril similarly, conservation international identified legal rollbacks to environmental protections as a key threat during the pandemic, launching a website to track such rollbacks and putting the issue on policymakers’ radars in an editorial in scientific american. fisheries devastated a conservation international study analyzed the extent of that damage to small-scale fisheries — the coastal and non-industrial fishing enterprises that make up more than 90 percent of the global fishing industry — and what must be done to bring them back. an ounce of prevention then in july, mere months after the pandemic hit, conservation international scientists co-authored a landmark study in the journal science showing that society could prevent future pandemics through nature conservation for a small fraction of the many trillions of dollars that covid-19 will cost humanity. the insights in this paper were widely cited and have since became a foundational component of pandemic prevention and recovery initiatives for the u.s. congress, the biden administration and european policymakers.
