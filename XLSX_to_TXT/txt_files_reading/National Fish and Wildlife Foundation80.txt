 for 30 years, nfwf has pursued a single mission: to protect and restore our nation’s fish, wildlife and habitats. we are the nation’s largest conservation funder, supporting projects across the united states and abroad to ensure that our precious natural heritage thrives. powered by funding from federal and state agencies, corporations, foundations and individual donors, nfwf creates dynamic partnerships to help solve complex conservation challenges. from coral reefs to grasslands, forests and deserts, we use the best science to implement major programs with measurable impact. here, we share a few examples of our work in 2013.
