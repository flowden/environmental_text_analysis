 on the first day of lent, under a full moon, traditional fishermen head out in the gulf of california to fish for curvina, a salmon-sized fish native to the area. itâ€™s a decades-old ritual that sustains local communities. the fishery is as large as the u.s. red snapper fishery, but overfishing has caused a perennial glut in supply, crashing prices and putting the survival of the species at risk. historically, fishermen would land thousands of tons of these fish in just a few days. edf teamed up with regional organizations to create a catch share program for curvina. by bringing together fishermen, government officials and buyers, the community developed an agreement in which each skiff was granted a per-tide allocation. the result? fishermen are earning 23% more per pound of fish, and the catch is distributed across the entire season. catch shares have also reduced the total catch by half, ensuring longterm health of the population. edf has now been asked by the hake industry to protect their fishery as well.
