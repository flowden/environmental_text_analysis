 in the past year, we invested in komaza, a smallholder agroforestry producer in kenya that pays farmers to raise trees on their land for sustainable wood. after our investment, komaza increased full-time staff by more than 10 percent and increased the number of farmers growing trees by over 13 percent, to 16,000 farmers. we also invested in victory farms, africa’s fastest-growing sustainable aquaculture operation, located on lake victoria, kenya. the company employs 350 full-time staff members — most from the communities surrounding the fish farms where job opportunities are scarce. these two landmark deals offered powerful evidence that investing in sustainable development can pay off for investors, for communities and for nature. conservation requires livelihoods to be sustainable. to that end, our investment fund, ci ventures, provides loans to small businesses operating in places where conservation international works — including africa.
