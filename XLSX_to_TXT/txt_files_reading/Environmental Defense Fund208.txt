 dealing with this massive pollution took a decade of effort by edf and others. we played a key role in supreme court cases that affirmed epa’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. when epa missed a deadline in april 2013 to release its new power plant standards, edf threatened legal action. “we never gave up,” says edf’s general counsel vickie patton. once the standards were proposed, the coal industry petitioned the u.s. supreme court to strip epa of its authority over carbon pollution. edf sprang into action. joining 17 states, we urged the court to deny the petitions. and our action fund ran tv ads in eight states, mobilizing citizens to shore up support in congress. the proposed standards remain on track, but a well-funded coal lobby is trying to strong-arm congress to cut funding for epa. the best arguments against that lobby are the hard-headed calculations of the energy industry itself. our partnership with xcel has helped transform states into test beds for the low-carbon future. when the obama administration wavered, we made sure these business voices were heard. “edf and power companies are working together to show that commonsense progress is possible,” says patton, who led our legal team in defending the standards. “we demonstrated that even in fast-growing states, you can provide reliable, lowcost energy and make dramatic cuts in global warming pollution.”
