 for audubon to remain relevant and vibrant and successfully achieve its vital mission of hemispheric conservation, the organization and the people who carry out the mission must reflect not just the diversity of the physical world we share with birds but the diversity of the people who live alongside those birds. in other words, audubon as an organization is vigorously strengthened by the diverse perspectives of all those who thrive with birds, in our cities, our rural areas, and in between. the notion of community conservation is about extending audubonâ€™s reach and pushing us to broaden our idea of what conservation means. it is about leveraging our awesome network of 47 centers and 465 chapters, which pumps the lifeblood into our conservation efforts. our centers and chapters bring together diverse communities of birds and people to create healthy, sustainable relation- ships. they are our heartbeat.
