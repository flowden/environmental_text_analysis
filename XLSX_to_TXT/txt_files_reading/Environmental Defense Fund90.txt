 at least a quarter of today’s global warming is driven by human-caused emissions of methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas. the oil and gas industry is the single-largest u.s. industrial source of methane pollution, but how much is actually leaking was unknown until edf brought together 150 scientists from 40 institutions to publish 34 peer-reviewed papers on the u.s. natural gas system. the studies revealed leakage much higher than epa estimates and led to the first national methane standards. to detect leaks quickly, industry needed a way to monitor facilities around the clock. so edf challenged inventors to develop detectors that react swiftly. one solution: solar-powered laser systems that upload data to a cloud server. “we can now address fugitive methane in real time, not weeks or months,” says andrea carolina machado miguens of statoil, the first producer to use the systems. pg&e and shell also plan to adopt them. our next frontier? mobile devices that can rapidly survey many facilities. edf is partnering with stanford university to test promising technologies.
