 at louisiana’s mollicy farms, the conservancy is working with partners to reconnect 25 square miles of floodplain forest to the ouachita river. the restoration, which includes removing portions of a 17-mile-long, 30-foot-tall levee, will improve habitat for fish and other species and provide vital ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, flood storage and water quality enhancement. the $4.5 million project is part of the conservancy’s great rivers partnership and is the largest floodplain restoration project ever in the mississippi river basin.
