 last year, a model we’ve worked tirelessly to establish saw its first success — three of them, actually — with the reintroduction of three elephants to the wild from the reteti elephant sanctuary in northern kenya. reteti, the first community-owned elephant sanctuary in africa, provides a place for injured elephants to heal and a home for elephants orphaned by poaching. it was established with assistance from conservation international and continues to operate thanks to funding from the organization and its partners. the three males, each about 3 years old, were moved to the nearby sera wildlife conservancy with minimal stress, thanks to the care of their keepers at reteti and the guidance of veterinarians from the kenya wildlife service. so far, the reintroduction has surpassed expectations, with the three young bulls quickly asserting their independence and growing and maturing faster than veterinarians had expected. soon they will fully integrate into the wild elephant herd at sera and live as the truly wild creatures they were meant to be. this success story would not be possible without the enabling conditions that conservation international has helped to establish across the northern kenya landscape, such as habitat integrity, safety and security, improved livelihoods, strong governance, management of humanwildlife conflict and more. with conservation international’s support, reteti is expanding to accommodate more tourism that can boost the sanctuary’s efforts and promote conservation across the region.
