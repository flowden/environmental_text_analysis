 why the conservancy works here: the community-based alternative energy program of southwest china, expanded with the help of the nature conservancy, aims to improve the lives of the rural poor and protect biodiversity while reducing deforestation within yunnan province. who lives here: millions of rural poor, who live on small farms and in villages, share the landscape with red pandas and yunnan golden monkeys. most of the medicinal plants used in chinese medicine come from yunnan province. what the conservancy is doing: we are introducing solar heating, micro-hydropower, bamboo housing and biogas-greenhouse units to yunnan communities. the conservancyâ€™s biogas stoves, powered by methane gas from biodegradable waste materials, have been a great success.
