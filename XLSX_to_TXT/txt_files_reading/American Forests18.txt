 in 2017, american forests restored nearly 300 acres of forest in the lower rio grande valley (lrgv) of southern texas, an extraordinary place where we have supported two-thirds of all restoration over the last 20 years. just before christmas last december, biologists at the laguna atascosa national wildlife refuge in texas displayed photos of a 3-week-old male ocelot kitten found in the first confirmed den on the refuge since 1997. given there are only around 50 endangered ocelots known to still roam the lrgv, this was great news. the lrgv is the fertile river delta of the rio grande river. the combination of climate, vegetation and associated wildlife create an ecosystem unlike any other in america. the local texas thornscrub vegetation provides habitat for many plant and wildlife species including 530 birds, 300 butterflies, and 1,200 plants. the endangered ocelot is a texas thornscrub specialist, using the dense forest to hunt and protect its family. however, this diverse habitat remains under threat from sprawling development and new threats like the border wall.
