 industrial livestock operations routinely give antibiotics to animals that aren't sick. exposed to too many of these drugs, bacteria can mutate into "superbugs" that have become immune to those antibiotics. in october 2015, the restaurant chain subway responded to an nrdc campaign by committing to eliminate antibiotics from its meat supply. pressure from nroc and ethers earlier that year also drove perdue and foster farms to stop giving antibiotics to healthy animals. and california set the strictest antibiotics standards in the nation with a measure nrdc helped strengthen.
