 every year, we burn fossil fuels – coal, oil, and gas – which have taken half a million years to form. while the full impacts of the resulting carbon dioxide (co2 ) gases emitted will only become truly apparent in the decades and cen- turies to come, some of the earth’s more fragile places such as the arctic and mountain wetlands are already feeling the heat. solutions are at hand but must begin immediately. this is crucial because even if current levels of global warming are reduced by 50 per cent over the next few years, the effects – sea-level rise, melting ice caps, soaring temperatures, unpredictable and violent weather, and loss of species and habitats – would continue well into the next century. as well as looking to reduce global warming through renewable energies – such as wind and solar power – and a more efficient use of energy, wwf is helping communities adapt to a changing climate. actions such as restoring damaged forests, wetlands, and other habitats increase their resilience and help to generate income. without such actions, climate change might well be the final blow to already stressed ecosystems and the human populations that depend on them. in addition, wwf’s climate change programme is pushing industrialized countries to reduce their current levels of co2 emissions by ten per cent below 1990 levels, by 2010. solutions are also being sought in developing countries to significantly reduce their greenhouse gases. and wwf is pressing countries to develop national plans to prevent climate change from damaging wildlife- rich areas such as national parks and reserves. around the globe, wwf is fighting climate change – the challenge is to make sure it happens fast enough. the dramatic flooding in many parts of the world in 2002 may provide the spur to faster action
