 in the wake of hurricane sandy, the new york city mayor’s offi ce asked the nature conservancy to prepare a conceptual study on how a mix of natural and built defenses could be implemented in a dense urban area. data from the report, “integrating natural infrastructure into urban coastal resilience,” was used to secure a $50 million commitment from fema to restore and test natural infrastructure at spring creek park adjacent to the howard beach community, with the conservancy as a key advisor to the restoration design process. as an outgrowth of the new york state 2100 commission, to which mark tercek was able to bring conservancy scientifi c expertise, the community resilience and disaster risk reduction act was signed into law, requiring applicants to state permitting and funding programs to use the best available science to plan for risks from sea level rise, storm surge and flooding (above). it also requires the state to adopt a set of scientifically based sea level rise projections. nature.org/ar-newyork
