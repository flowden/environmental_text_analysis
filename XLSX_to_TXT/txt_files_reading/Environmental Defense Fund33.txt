 in 2020, china will roll out its national emissions trading system, initially covering 1,700 companies in the power sector and keeping the country on track to meet its commitment under the paris agreement. as the system expands, it will become the world’s largest carbon market. edf, with our 28-year history in china, has helped guide the system’s design. the initial phase represents more than one-third of china’s carbon emissions. the plan is to scale up the emissions trading system gradually to include other sectors, such as cement and steel manufacturing, which would cover a total of 7,000 companies and help to continue china’s leadership in climate action. accountability is key. the transition is being overseen by a new generation of environmental enforcement officers, more than 55,000 of whom were trained in a program edf established with leading universities.
