 from the coastal waters of sodwana in south africa to chisamayu, some 4,600 kilometres to the north in somalia, the eastern african seas are home to a wealth of tropical wildlife and millions of coastal people. yet all is far from well along these golden coasts, particularly in and around major towns and river mouths. here, pollution, the over-harvesting of fish, molluscs, crustaceans and sea cucum- bers, and the destruction of coastal forests and coral reefs – partly as a result of climate change – are all taking a toll. turtles and dolphins are declining as a result of both deliberate and accidental capture, as is the rare dugong which lives its entire life in coastal waters wwf has been working with partners, such as the western indian ocean marine science association, as well as local communities, such as bee-keeping and tree-planting groups, on a conserva- tion plan for this vast ecoregion. it aims, among other things, to stop the damage being done to coral reefs and the species that live in them, and to protect at least 100,000 hectares of mangrove forests and their wildlife. already, two outstanding areas in mozambique have been protected. the 140,000-hectare bazaruto archipelago national park, in which wwf has been working for the past 15 years, provides much needed protection for the highly endangered dugong, while the newly created quirimbas national park – 150,000 hectares of which form a marine protected area – safeguards both the area’s fish stocks and the rights of local fishing communities that depend on them. these efforts were recognized by wwf as gifts to the earth.
