 the conservancy led a unique public- private partnership that launched forever costa rica, a groundbreaking initiative that will at least double costa rica’s marine protected areas, dramatically improve protected area management and provide necessary financing to sustain these efforts in perpetuity. the partnership has mobilized more than $50 million, including $29 million in private donations to the conservancy and a $27 million debt-for-nature swap with the united states, in which the conservancy is a private counterpart. the goal is to meet costa rica’s commitments under the u.n. convention on biological diversity by 2015.
