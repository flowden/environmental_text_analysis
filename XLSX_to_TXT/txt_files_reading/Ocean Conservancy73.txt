 once again, ocean conservancy and hundreds of thousands of volunteers around the world joined in the inter- national coastal cleanup—our twenty- fourth annual event. participants removed trash and debris from coastlines, keeping track of every piece of trash they found. ocean conservancy, in turn, compiled and published the data in the world’s only annual country-by-country, state-by-state index of the problem of marine debris. a rising tide of ocean debris and what we can do about it, our report on results of the 2008 international coastal cleanup, was a resounding call to action for prevention of trash in our ocean and highlighted the interconnectedness of marine debris, wildlife, and climate change on ocean health. as such, it represented a significant shift for the cleanup by combining the power of data with our in-house wildlife and climate change expertise to provide a roadmap for the ultimate elimination of marine debris. in 2009, the main theme for the international coastal cleanup was “partnership.” we solidified our role as the de facto leader of a broad coalition of public, corporate, non-profit, and government interests who are working together closely to find a solution to marine debris. ocean conservancy and the un environment programme (unep) joined forces to publish the first-ever examination of marine litter in 12 seas around the world. we also announced an extensive new partnership between planet green, unep, philippe and alexandra cousteau, oceana, and the natural resources defense council in planet green’s “blue august”—an entire month of programming dedicated to ocean-themed conservation issues. lastly, we formed a partnership with earth day network in which volunteer participation in the icc will be counted towards earth day network’s “billion acts of green” campaign in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of earth day in 2010. the international coastal cleanup is a resounding call to action to prevent trash in our ocean.
