 the build-out of new renewable energy is underway, and at an unprecedented pace. yet some of the most promising clean-energy sources, such as wind and large- scale solar installations, call for large areas of land. scientists at tnc are showing how nations can meet global clean-energy goals while protecting natural lands. the conservancy’s site wind right interactive mapping is helping industry accelerate planning while steering infrastructure development away from sensitive habitat in the great plains, and new strategies are doing the same for solar energy in california, nevada and west virginia. in india, tnc’s new siteright tool is proving a necessary planning asset for the country’s rapidly expanding renewable-energy sector. says tnc’s dhaval negandhi, an ecological economist, “if you don’t think about these impacts, they become conflicts that impede and slow down your project.” with india’s ambitious national clean-energy targets in place, the industry can’t afford build-out delays, so tnc’s smart siting tool offers a pathway to a new clean-energy future.
