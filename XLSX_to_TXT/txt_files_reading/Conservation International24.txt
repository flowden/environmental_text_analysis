 in march 2012, more than 60 scientists from ci-brazil, local universities, boston university and the new england aquarium undertook the last leg of a three-legged expedition to explore brazil’s abrolhos bank. the study’s findings—such as the discovery of the ecological functions of “buracas” (large shafts in the seafloor) that could help cycle critical nutrients through the ocean ecosystem—will give researchers and policymakers a deeper understanding of an area that supports vast fishing and tourism industries and more than 100,000 jobs.
