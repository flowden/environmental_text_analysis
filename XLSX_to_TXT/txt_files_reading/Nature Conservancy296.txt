 doug oberhelman is vice chairman and chief executive officer-elect at caterpillar inc., which, through its foundation, made a $12 million gift to the nature conservancy in 2005 to establish the great rivers partnership. “the inspiration for the great rivers partnership (grp) developed from over 30 years of restoration projects conducted by caterpillar and the nature conservancy along the illinois river. through this work, it became apparent that environmental improvements needed to be connected to a system-wide strategy to ensure long-term viability. caterpillar’s multiyear investment to establish the grp enabled multiple freshwater projects on three major river systems to collaborate across boundaries. the grp is leveraging best practices, enhancing outcomes and making long-term sustainability possible. but the grp is about more than just conserving the environment. it is a partnership committed to promoting conservation, economic sustainability and human well-being by protecting the world’s largest and most periled river systems. our efforts benefit economies, ecologies and the millions of people around the world who depend on them. i’m proud that the grp’s accomplishments continue to encourage others to join our efforts to protect freshwater resources for current and future generations.”
