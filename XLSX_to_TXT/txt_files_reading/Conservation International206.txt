 the agility and expertise of conservation international was brought to bear last year when, virtually overnight, the world’s attention turned to an unprecedented surge in fires across the amazon. our communications team sprang into action, publishing daily online updates of the situation to share our expertise and analysis with the media and the public. engagement with our communications channels — and awareness of the organization’s work — skyrocketed. meanwhile, conservation international’s science and finance teams got to work. analyzing data on the fires, our scientists soon found that most of the fires stopped at the boundaries of protected areas and indigenous lands — a testament to conservation international’s tireless work to help establish these areas, and a clear signal that these areas need continued support in the face of legal changes that could eliminate them. on the finance and policy front, conservation international helped create and launch a fund to support the leticia pact, a south american-led agreement to protect the amazon that had been inked just weeks before. the government of france quickly pledged $100 million to the initiative, with conservation international and our longtime partner apple joining to commit an additional $20 million aimed at supporting indigenous communities and civil society in the region. none of this would have been possible without nimble teams, a clear strategy, and a longstanding and active presence in the countries of the amazon.
