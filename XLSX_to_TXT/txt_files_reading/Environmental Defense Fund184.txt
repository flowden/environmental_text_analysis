 china burns roughly half the world’s coal. this has helped lift the country out of poverty, but at a steep price in terms of air pollution and climate change. edf is helping the country address those twin dangers by taking important steps toward cleaner energy. to drive prosperity while reining in emissions, china is harnessing the power of the marketplace. with edf’s involvement, the country has launched emissions trading programs in five cities and two provinces, home to 250 million people. edf trained more than 1,000 government officials and others on key elements of emissions trading, including verification. china now hopes to launch national emissions trading by 2016 and is aiming for a 17% reduction in carbon intensity from 2010 levels by 2015. the country is on track to meet that goal. also in 2014: w china tightened penalties on polluters, a reform that edf has advocated for more than a decade. the ceiling on penalties will be scrapped, officials will be held more accountable and citizens will have more power to sue. the reforms, which reuters called “the most sweeping revisions to the law in 25 years,” are modeled on an edf pilot enforcement project in chongqing. w edf and shenzhen launched a research project aimed at reducing carbon pollution from the city’s vehicles, which have soared from 200,000 to 2.7 million in ten years. the project will incorporate mobile sources into shenzhen’s existing carbon emissions trading program, which was created with help from edf. the shenzhen vehicle project was picked as a u.s.-china ecopartnership by both governments, one of six such projects selected this year.
