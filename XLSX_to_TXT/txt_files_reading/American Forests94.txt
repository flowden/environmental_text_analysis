 to ensure important roles for forests and communities in policy debates on climate change and building a green economy, we developed issue papers with our community-based forest policy partners, and convened meetings with key policymakers in congress and the administration. while coordinating with our western partners, the rural voices for conservation coalition, we received support from the ford foundation to begin developing a complementary network of community-based partners in the eastern u.s. we made exciting progress in developing an innovative carbon- offset project in california. with california state parks, we helped develop and support the first reforestation project on public lands to be approved in a major carbon-offset market, the climate action reserve. this cuyamaca rancho state park project funded by conoco-phillips will help increase the participation of forest-sector projects in emerging carbon markets. we also submitted recommendations on the federal economic stimulus package to the house and senate, and supported the revised flame act, which addresses concerns about the growing costs of wildfire suppression.
