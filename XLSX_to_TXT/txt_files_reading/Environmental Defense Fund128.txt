 in the mid-1970s, edf became the first u.s. environmental group to hire ph.d. economists to work alongside our scientists, lawyers and policy experts. some environmentalists were skeptical, but results soon showed we could win greater pollution reductions at lower cost by tapping the power of innovation. since then, economics has been integral to our success in all program areas. our market-based plan to reduce acid rain, which had been devastating lakes and forests, was written into the 1990 clean air act. the legislation required power plants to cut their sulfur dioxide pollution in half, but let them decide how to do it. to date, so2 emissions have dropped by more than 85% overall, at a fraction of the predicted cost. for oceans, edf’s partnerships with fishermen helped overcome a congressional moratorium on catch shares, an economically effective method to protect fisheries. and in 2010, the national oceanic and atmospheric administration adopted our approach as part of its official policy to end overfishing. granting fishermen secure fishing rights works, because it aligns the needs of fishermen with the needs of the oceans and the people who depend on seafood for nourishment. rigorous economics has helped edf win greater results at lower cost for clean air, clean water and habitat protection, prompting the economist to call edf “america’s most economically literate green campaigners.”
