 to meet aggressive targets under the paris climate agreement — and avoid a climate catastrophe — more countries are looking to put a price on carbon emissions. today, roughly 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions have some form of carbon price applied to them. in 2018, the total value of carbon pricing initiatives globally was $82 billion, a 56 percent increase from the previous year. one encouraging development: there is also growing interest in neutralizing carbon emissions by protecting forests — and a growing slate of ready projects to leverage the conservation of nature as a climate solution. conservation international is now working with the governments of colombia, ecuador and peru to help establish carbon pricing systems that increase their investment in tropical forests and other high-carbon ecosystems. among other recommendations, we have identified an existing program that reduces corporate tax liability based on investments that could be linked to a carbon tax to encourage corporate investment in forest conservation.
