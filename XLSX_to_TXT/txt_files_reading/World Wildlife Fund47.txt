 ten years ago, the ground-breaking earth summit in rio de janeiro placed environmental, social, and economic issues on the international policy agenda and gave us agenda 21 – a global blueprint adopted by more than 178 governments for ending poverty and caring for the environment. ten years on, two billion people – one-third of the world’s population – live in extreme poverty, lacking clean water, adequate sanitation, and access to energy. environmental degradation has continued unabated – the crisis facing the world’s rainforests, for example, had already become a worldwide cause before the earth summit, but since then land clearance has continued and half of the world’s tropical rainforests are now lost forever. during the often troubled preparations for the follow-up to rio – the world summit on sustainable development (wssd) in johannesburg in august – wwf called for action that would be innovative, practical, and deliverable within a clear timeframe. in particular, we were seeking progress on three interconnected issues: fighting poverty and promoting sustainable ways of living, encouraging more earth- friendly behaviour, and protecting the forest, freshwater, and marine ecosystems on which all life ultimately depends. these are the areas in which wwf has developed considerable expertise. long before the phrase “sustainable development” was coined, wwf was promoting ways for people and nature to live in harmony. our work with local communities, for example, combines the careful use of natural resources with conservation of plant and animal life, helping at the same time to ease the burden of poverty. wwf’s continuing search for practical solutions to the challenges confronting humanity is reflected throughout the pages of this report. by focusing on a limited number of global issues and those parts of the earth which hold the greatest biological diversity, wwf and a growing number of partners worldwide continue to act for people and the planet.
