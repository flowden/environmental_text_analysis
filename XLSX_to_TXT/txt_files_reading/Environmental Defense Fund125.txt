 the mesoamerican reef—the largest barrier reef in the western hemisphere—hugs the belizean coast and supports nearly 500 species of fish. many local residents depend on the reef for their survival, but overfishing and development have taken a toll. in 2008, edf teamed up with the wildlife conservation society and local partners to enlist fishermen, policymakers and managers in pilot projects to help preserve the reef by ending the threat of overfishing. local fishermen were granted rights to fish in a designated area and became stewards of their fisheries. in just a few years, fish populations began to rebound in nearby marine reserves, and illegal fishing dropped 60%. that progress led the government to roll out the system nationwide. in june 2016, belize became the first country to adopt a national, multispecies fishing rights program for small-scale fisheries. “the adoption of fishing rights here shows other countries that reforms can benefit both the environment and fishermen,” says larry epstein, director of edf’s belize oceans project.
