 in 2019, american forests officially kicked off the first year of our natural climate solutions initiative, which strives to increase urban forests statewide in rhode island. through direct engagement with municipalities, american forests and state authorities will support tree planting and tree care activities, strengthen relationships with nursery and landscape associations and develop an online decision support tool to assist with optimizing urban tree planting for environmental and public health benefits. american forests is piloting this transformative initiative in rhode island to more broadly expand u.s. forest sector interest in natural climate solutions, and we seek to replicate this work in other states across the country and improve federal policies that further the potential of natural climate solutions in federal spending and land stewardship. led by rhode island’s chief resilience officer, in concert with the governor’s resilient rhody action plan to drive climate resilience efforts, this initiative is made possible through generous financial support from the doris duke charitable foundation.
