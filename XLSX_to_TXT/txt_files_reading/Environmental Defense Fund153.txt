 too often, the right to breathe clean air has been denied to low-income communities and communities of color. people living near the nation’s ports, truck routes and industrial facilities are disproportionately exposed to dangerous air pollution. “people who live in pollution hot spots face an increased health risk from smog and fine particles and toxics like benzene and mercury,” says dr. elena craft, an edf toxicologist who works with these communities. smog is a particular problem, contributing to heart and lung diseases and worsening asthma. refineries are a big contributor to smog and air toxics, but federal rules on refinery pollution are weak. thanks in part to edf’s advocacy, epa in 2015 announced stronger rules for regulating toxic air emissions from refineries. then, after a lawsuit filed by edf and others, epa tightenedthe national air quality standard for ozone, the main cause of smog. cars and trucks are the largest source of smog-forming pollutants. edf is helping slash such pollution from trucks for the 18 million mostly low-income people who live near america’s ports. at the port of houston, one of the nation’s busiest, we helped develop a lowinterest loan and grant program that helps the port’s truckers replace older, polluting trucks with new models. in 2015, epa expanded the program. nationwide, big freight trucks are getting a makeover, too: proposed new standards, which edf and our allies helped secure, will make heavy trucks almost 25% more efficient. improved engine standards mean less smog— and that means americans with lung ailments can breathe a little easier. edf helped activists such as houston’s yudith nieto acquire air samplers that for the first time provide a more accurate picture of what they’re breathing. “at the end of the day, there has to be hope,” says nieto, “hope that our voices will be heard.”
