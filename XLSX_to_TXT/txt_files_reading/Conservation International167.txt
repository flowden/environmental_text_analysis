 there is no more powerful inspiration for conserving a place than seeing it for yourself. not everyone can travel to africa, though, so we are bringing africa to them — in virtual reality. “my africa,” conservation international’s third vr film, tells the story of a young woman in kenya whose community is working to save elephants, reknitting an ancient coexistence between people and wildlife. narrated by acadamy award winning (and kenyan-raised) actress lupita nyong’o and directed by four-time emmy winner david allen, the project was filmed in northern kenya’s reteti elephant sanctuary, the first elephant orphanage in africa owned and operated by the local community. our partnership with reteti is part of our broader work in africa to protect nature while sustaining livelihoods. in a region where conservation has traditionally been pursued by wealthy outsiders, reteti offers a model grounded in local leadership and traditional knowledge of the landscape. in “my africa,” viewers glimpse a path forward: communities working for the long-term success of nature, and reaping the benefits. as of dec. 31, 2018, the film — which is available in seven languages — had been viewed nearly 100,000 times. the film, produced by passion pictures in association with vision3 and with the support of the tiffany & co. foundation and glassybaby, premiered at the tribeca film festival in new york.
