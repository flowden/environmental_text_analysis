 as we closed out the fiscal year, we also completed our five-year, $1-billion “future for life” campaign a year early, laying the groundwork for ci to move from an organization protecting species and places to a global group taking actions that impact ecosystems, economies and cultures as a whole. that is the key story of conservation international in fy09: our strategic planning and long-standing depth of experience combined to create expanded partnerships and successes at a larger scale than ever before. by developing integrated strategies—both for the protection of global ecosystems and engaging societies worldwide—ci achieved a year of vital change and growth, benefiting both our organization and people, species and habitats around the world. the support of our membership, event attendees, emerald circle donors, chairman’s council and board of directors underlies all of our successes in fy09, and beyond. together, we are proving to the world’s communities, countries and societies that all people and all life need nature to thrive.
