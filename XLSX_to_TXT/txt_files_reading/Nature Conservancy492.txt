 the indonesian park authority’s first two floating ranger stations began patrolling the waters of indonesia’s 712-square-mile komodo national park, providing a 24-hour presence to eliminate illegal fishing practices. the boats, donated by the nature conservancy, come after years of building community awareness of marine resources and helping partners pass laws to protect them. since the stations’ launch, more than 20 poachers have been arrested and sentenced to jail time, includ- ing six who will serve 2.5-year jail terms for using cyanide to stun reef fish. such practices have caused irreparable damage to coral reefs in the park.
