 launched new efforts to protect beaches—and sea turtles—from harmful debris in 2014, we expanded our sea turtle- marine debris monitoring program from one north carolina area in 2013 to over 16 sea turtle nesting beaches throughout the southeastern u.s. in total, turtle volunteers removed more than 54,000 pieces of harmful debris from beach zones where loggerhead, green and leatherback sea turtles made their nests. we also launched the “last straw challenge” which asked people to pledge to “skip the straw” when dining out. more than 25,000 people took the pledge, which will keep more than 5 million plastic straws out of our ocean and landfills in the coming year alone.
