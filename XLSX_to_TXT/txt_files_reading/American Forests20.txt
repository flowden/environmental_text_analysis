 for over a century, american forests has been a leader in promoting urban tree canopy for the health, sustainability and livability of cities. with this year’s launch of the vibrant cities lab, american forests has taken the leadership role in bringing urban forestry expertise online. through this first-ever digital hub for urban forestry, city managers and other leaders can now access powerful information and tools to lead successful local reforestation efforts in cities and towns across america. our award-winning community releaf program has also expanded its partnerships with cities to bring tree equity to underserved communities. through american forests’ uniquely comprehensive process, we have developed strong coalitions, scientific data and action plans to launch large-scale reforestation efforts in such cities as detroit, miami, houston and dallas. these new partnerships and american forests’ longstanding work in cities like chicago, cleveland, san francisco and los angeles generated important urban tree planting projects that brought leafy, green canopy to cities across america in 2017. our community releaf partnerships are helping expand the reach and benefits of urban forestry farther, faster and to the neighborhoods most in need.
