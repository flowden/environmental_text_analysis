 it is impossible to overestimate the contribution made by the world’s forests to the well-being of the planet. forests form a complex and extraordinarily diverse ecosystem – a fragile, intricate, interdependent web made up of micro-organisms, soils, insects, animals and flowers, as well as the trees themselves. forests are the earth’s purifiers, “breathing” in much of the excess co2 we pump into the atmosphere and exhaling the oxygen upon which all life depends. they provide water, food, fuel, shelter, medicines, spiritual sustenance, and countless other valuable services. yet despite their value, over 50 per cent of the world’s original forests have already gone and they continue to disappear at a rate of about 13 million hectares a year. at wwf, we believe we can avert this disaster through a mix of protection, restoration, responsible forestry, and by addressing consumption issues. the forest stewardship council (fsc) – a certification system that wwf helped set up in 1994 to ensure wood and wood products come from forests that are sustainably managed – now has nearly 80 million hectares of certified forests and around 20,000 fsc-labelled products on sale worldwide.
