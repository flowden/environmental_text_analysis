 picking conservation investments has always been part art and part science. we’ve got the artists and now we’ve got the science. using a host of new metrics and innovative ways to value land, species, and other attributes that are important to people and the environment, nfwf is creating a new approach to pick the best conservation investments. our strategy includes: identifying wildlife most in need of conservation action; focusing on wildlife whose status can be measurably improved through our grants; requiring a strict, outcome-based approach to investing, demanding measurable accomplishments; evaluating progress at every step of the way and changing course when doing so will expand our success; and prioritizing americans’ quality of life by funding projects that help wildlife, but also improve freshwater supplies, remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, and help clean up lakes, rivers, and bays.
