 each year, new species will be identified as keystone initiatives. working closely with partners, nfwf staff are developing detailed business plans for each species and a blueprint for action to achieve the desired population changes. the following metrics will be used to gauge our progress: tracking regional and national population changes in species where on-the-ground conservation actions are underway; assessing intermediate measures, such as changes in habitat quality and quantity; identifying key bird population metrics towards which conservation actions are best directed; increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of organizations in bringing about positive changes in bird populations; and comparing the relative efficacy of targeting single species versus suites of multiple species, as well as the efficacy of targeting declining (but still common) species versus federally endangered species.
