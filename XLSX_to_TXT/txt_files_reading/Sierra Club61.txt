 marvin winstead, a small crop farmer in rural north carolina, received a notice by mail on may 21, 2014, of plans to build the atlantic coast pipeline through the middle of his property. his farm is his livelihood, and he knew that no amount of remediation would salvage his land once it was torn up. he is one of thousands of landowners affected by this pipeline. as a landowner, he sees a clear abuse of eminent domain, given that duke energy and dominion energy are private utility companies making an economic gain with this seizure of private property. he has been an activist with the sierra club since, working with our allies to fight the pipeline construction.
