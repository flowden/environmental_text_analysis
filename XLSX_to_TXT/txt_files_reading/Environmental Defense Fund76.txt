 oregon fisherman brad pettinger has witnessed the complete turnaround of the pacific groundfish fishery, once declared a federal disaster, a recovery that stems in part from sustainable fishing policies championed by edf. now he’s testing new smart-boat technologies that could help troubled fisheries around the world. working with pettinger and others, edf is experimenting with cameras, machine learning, low-cost sensors and broadband offshore internet connections to monitor fishing more accurately. the innovations improve accountability and reduce the need for expensive human observers. “information is a powerful tool,” says pettinger, the former head of the oregon trawl commission. networked fishing vessels could share data while at sea, enabling better fisheries management and business decisions in real time, reducing waste. “i envision a fully integrated information system,” says pettinger, “from the vessel clear to the market.” just as smartphones stimulated innovation, smart boats could revolutionize fishing worldwide by providing more precise data on fish populations and habitat conditions than ever before, while enhancing compliance with fisheries law.
