 for two days, wwf scientists nirmal bhagabati and nasser olwero walked the wildlife-rich forests and swampy peatlands of tesso nilo national park, as well as the adjacent palm and acacia plantations that are driving much of sumatra’s deforestation. they fed their on-the-ground observations into a cutting-edge data-analysis tool called invest. invest (integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs) was developed by wwf, stanford university, the nature conservancy and the university of minnesota to assess the quality and distribution of wildlife habitat and nature-based services like carbon storage, freshwater delivery and water purification. invest shows how potential development plans—both “business as usual” and more sustainable options—would affect forests and other landscapes. sumatra’s district and provincial governments are integrating this information into their land-use plans, including zoning decisions and concessions for economic activities. in concert with wwf’s efforts to improve the palm, pulp and paper, and timber industries’ impact on the island’s biodiversity, this work is helping sumatra better balance environmental realities with people’s social and economic needs.
