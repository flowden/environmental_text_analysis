 liberia is at a crossroads. hectare for hectare, the west african country has some of the highest above-ground stocks of forest carbon in the world. after years of civil war, can it grow sustainably? in 2017, conservation international published findings from the first-ever national assessment of liberia’s essential “natural capital” — the sources of the benefits that nature provides, including carbon storage, flood control and biodiversity. scientists found that designated protected areas currently protect only 7 percent of the nature liberia needs — but that new proposals for protection could increase that figure to 26 percent. in the next year, ci will help liberia’s government better understand the true value of nature to the national economy. with this knowledge, the government will be able to make decisions about how to grow while protecting its natural wealth.
