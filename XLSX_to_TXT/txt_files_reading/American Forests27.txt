 few cities have suffered as dramatic a transformation as detroit, with its economic collapse taking a toll on trees, greenspace and the communities that benefit from them. as part of a broader effort to implement a citywide reforestation plan, american forests worked with bank of america and local partners to create the cityâ€™s first outdoor education center for use by students from nearby schools. the space also serves as a new town square, embraced by the osborn neighborhood as central to other revitalization efforts in the community. multiple abandoned homes were removed and replaced with tree canopy, butterfly habitat, paths, benches and a playground for residents to enjoy time spent outdoors.
