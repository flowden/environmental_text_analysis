 redoubled our efforts to restore the gulf of mexico in the wake of historic $20.8 billion settlement for bp deepwater horizon oil disaster since the bp disaster polluted the gulf with nearly five million barrels of oil, damage to fishing communities and marine wildlife continues to emerge. roughly four to eight billion oysters were lost, and bottlenose dolphins are expected to take 40–50 years to recover. the settlement will help us address spill impacts and achieve long-term restoration goals. the inclusion of over $1 billion for ocean restoration— as well as separate funds to monitor long-term spill effects—were major victories. ocean conservancy remains steadfast in ensuring that every dime of funding is directed as intended.
