 ocean conservancy’s efforts to end overfishing and restore threatened ocean ecosystems made important strides this year. in the gulf of mexico, we worked with fishermen in the for-hire sector to develop a new catch reporting system using electronic logbooks. this new system increases the timeliness and accuracy of data while improving opportunities for fishermen to sustainably catch more fish. in the pacific, we worked with partners to advance strategic planning that identifies effective approaches for adapting fishery management to climate change, so that we can continue to have sustainable fisheries that support fishing communities into the future. and we worked with members of congress, particularly with congressman joseph cunningham (d-sc), to introduce a bill to help identify and prioritize actions to accelerate our transition to climate-ready fishery management. we are also tackling a critically important global fishery — tropical tuna. in partnership with a regional management body in the eastern pacific ocean, we’re using our unique “flight simulator” to help managers better understand the implications of rapidly changing conditions that threaten the fishery’s sustainability.
