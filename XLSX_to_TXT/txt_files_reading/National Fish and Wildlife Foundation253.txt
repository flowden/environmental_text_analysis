 good birders use a filtering process to identify species. using geographic range, size, behavior, and plumage patterns, they systematically narrow the list of possibilities until they successfully identify their quarry. picking conservation targets involves a similar filtering process. in 2007, the bird conservation keystone forged new ground with a pioneering system to identify those species that would become the focus of nfwf’s conservation programs. the goal is to secure the long-term survival of species that are clearly in trouble. established goals from recovery plans or other conservation documents are used to set population targets and business plans are developed to identify the most practical solutions to the species’ problems, thereby guiding nfwf’s funding efforts. over the past 15 years the partners in flight program, launched by nfwf in the early 1990s, has identified the birds most in need of conservation action—allowing us to narrow the list of potential keystone initiatives from 850 to about 200 species. the next filter in the process was to determine which of the 200 species could most benefit from nfwf investment. in some cases, population increases might take so long that nfwf grants would be impractical. in others, there are already many players involved and additional attention was not warranted. next, a more detailed costbenefit analysis was employed to estimate how much impact nfwf investments might have. finally, criteria such as ancillary benefits to other wildlife and a species’ iconic status with the public and conservation community were considered. from this group nfwf’s board selects targeted species.
