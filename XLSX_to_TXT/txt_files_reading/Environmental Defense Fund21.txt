 in september 2019, millions of young people around the globe — millennials and others who have the greatest stake in the future — led the largest climate action in history. tired of waiting for elected officials, they bring new energy and passion to the cause. at environmental defense fund, we’re contributing to this growing momentum. edf’s achievements of 2019, which you can read about in the following pages, help chart our course for 2020 and beyond. we’ve helped win climate action at the local, state, corporate and international levels, and we’ll continue working to slash fossil fuel dependence and move toward a 100% clean economy. to protect human health, we’ll keep fighting the trump administration’s assaults on vital environmental protections. we’re deploying powerful new technologies, such as networked air quality monitors and methanesat, the satellite we announced last year that will launch in 2022 and revolutionize our ability to hold oil and gas companies accountable for their methane emissions worldwide. such advances will enable edf and allies to win victories that match the scale of the challenges ahead. we’ll also expand our efforts to help communities, oceans and ecosystems become more resilient to climate change. this year’s collaboration between countries to predict climate impacts on fisheries, the agreement among three western states to conserve water and the consensus to help protect gulf coast residents from powerful storms all address ongoing challenges. we will ramp up our work in such areas to make an even bigger difference. to accelerate our progress globally, we will keep building a diverse and capable staff and board from around the world. we value the support we get from all communities. thank you for helping to make our work possible.
