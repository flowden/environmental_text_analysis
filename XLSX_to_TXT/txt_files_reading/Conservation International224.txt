 to address these issues, conservation international led the development of the monterey framework for socially responsible seafood, a protocol that now has over two dozen commitments from major seafood businesses. moving from principles to practice, we worked with governments, companies and researchers to help identify risks in seafood supply chains. built on the monterey framework, our social responsibility assessment tool offers practical indicators to uncover critical information gaps and areas that need improvement — including treatment of fishers, safety practices and other key rights and needs. we are taking these strategies to scale by applying them in entire national and regional jurisdictions. in the cook islands, for example, conservation international is collaborating with the government, the tuna seafood industry and traditional leadership groups to develop and apply rigorous standards of environmental sustainability, social responsibility and economic performance, which all tuna vessels operating within the cook island jurisdiction must meet. modern slavery, human trafficking, child labor — these human rights violations have only recently become part of the global dialogue around sustainably sourced seafood.
