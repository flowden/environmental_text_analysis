 in 1998, the nature conservancy launched conservation by design, a new approach to setting conservation priorities and preserving global biodiversity. that same year, the conservancy embarked upon the most ambitious fund-raising drive in its history. in 2003, the campaign for conservation drew to a successful close after raising more than $1.4 billion. this five-year campaign supported two goals. first, it enabled us to complete the initial draft of a conservation blueprint that identifies high-priority, biologically diverse areas in the continental united states and many international regions. second, it allowed us to establish conservation projects with partners at some 200 sites around the world. the projects pictured on this page are only a representative sample of those supported by the campaign for conservation. we are grateful to all our donors, large and small, who made this campaign such a success.
