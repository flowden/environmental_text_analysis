 tigers. wwf’s tiger work emphasizes field projects in priority tiger habitats in the indian sub-continent,the russian far east, and southeast asia. since 1997, the wwf network has provided more than us$ 1 million to support 19 tiger reserves in india with equipment, training, reward programmes, and compensation schemes aimed at stopping tiger poaching and help- ing villagers to live alongside the species. great whales. at the international whaling commission’s july meeting in australia, wwf urged governments to maintain the global whaling moratorium. specific wwf objectives included: greater protection of the north atlantic right whale, whose total population is now less than 1,000,making it the world’s most endan- gered great whale species; ending japanese “scientific” whaling in the southern ocean whale sanctuary; bringing norwegian whaling (which continues in spite of the moratorium) back under international control; and promoting new whale sanctuaries. african rhinos. numbers of the two species of african rhinoceros, the black rhino and the white rhino, continued to increase in the wild according to new estimates announced in july. there are now more rhino in the wild in africa than at any time since the early 1980s – just over 13,000 in 1999, up from 8,300 in 1992 – mainly due to the rapid growth in the number of southern white rhino and intensive conservation efforts in several african countries. the southern white rhino, rescued from near extinction a century ago, stands as one of the world’s greatest conservation success stories,up from approximately 20 in 1895 to just over 10,300 by 1999, with a further 721 in captivity worldwide. by contrast, the situation facing the northern white rhino sub-species is critical: less than 30 exist in the wild in a single population in the democratic republic of congo.
