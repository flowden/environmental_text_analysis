 an investment of $50,000 by the nature conservancy ensured the protection of more than 1,000 acres of native prairie habitat last year in saskatchewan, kicking off the organizationâ€™s efforts to protect the canadian missouri coteau landscape. this prairie region was identified as one of the most critical habi- tats for imperiled grassland birds, including the burrowing owl, loggerhead shrike and piping plover. the funds went to the inde- pendent organization nature conservancy of canada, making it eligible for matching grants to purchase the land. through an arrangement with public and private agencies, funding from the conservancy for land protection in saskatchewan and alberta is matched at a 4-1 ratio.
