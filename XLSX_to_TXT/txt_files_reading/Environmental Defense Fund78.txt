 for years, fishermen in sweden have collaborated with government officials and edf to design a sustainable fishing system for the country that could be replicated across europe. one goal is to address the wasteful practice of discarding fish that are caught inadvertently—often in excess of a fisherman’s quota—and then thrown overboard, frequently dead or dying. in 2019, when an eu ban on discarding fish comes into full effect, sweden will be ready. the country has adopted an online platform, fishright, that allows fishermen spotlight on indonesia in the world’s second-largest fishing nation, the governor of lampung province approved a sustainable management plan that edf helped design for blue swimming crab, indonesia’s third most lucrative fishery. to trade quotas in real time. they’re now free to fish, knowing they can stay within sustainable fishing limits, rather than exceed their quota and be forced to stop. it’s an elegant solution that comes at a critical time. many countries are unprepared for the discard ban and face disarray as they struggle to comply. sweden’s innovation can help. developed on an open-source platform, fishright is available for other countries to adopt. “swedish fishermen saw a challenge and stepped up to find a solution,” says edf’s nancy raditz.
