 the future of bird’s head seascape looks bright thanks to conservation international’s involvement in two key developments in 2015. the first was the local government’s declaration of west papua as a “conservation province,” a legal framework to ensure that economic development in the province doesn’t damage the environment. ci is providing technical support as the regulations are written. also in 2015, ci launched the blue abadi fund — “abadi” means “forever” in indonesian — to fund the long-term protection of the seascape. early financial support from the government of indonesia and ci has set a promising course, but more funding will be needed to protect this singular reservoir of tropical marine species in perpetuity.
