 true, the states of arizona, colorado and idaho are half a world away from mongolia. but in terms of habitats, they all share something in common: large swaths of grasslands. unfortunately, in the united states, mongolia and other places around the globe, grasslands are rapidly disappearing. to address this problem, conservationists from mongolia and the united states are exchanging information and techniques in a hands-on program that puts each group onto the other’s home turf. recently, conservationists from mongolia toured grasslands in arizona, colorado and idaho to learn more about the nature conservancy’s conservation approach. similarly, conservancy staff members are studying how the mostly nomadic mongolians have maintained grasslands for thousands of years by grazing goats, camels and cattle. “they come here to look into their future, and we go there looking into our past,” says chris pague, a conservancy ecologist. exchanges among conservationists and community leaders in the many places the conservancy works are becoming more commonplace. leaders representing the coordination of indigenous organizations of the brazilian amazon traveled to british columbia to meet with first nations representatives and learn more about the sustainable management of timber and fisheries in the great bear rainforest. as a matter of course, the conservancy’s great rivers partnership brings conservationists together around common issues related to brazil’s paraguay- paraná river, china’s yangtze river and the united states’ mississippi river.
