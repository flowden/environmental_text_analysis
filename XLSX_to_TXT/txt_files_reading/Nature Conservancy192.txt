 “there have been big changes since the start of the west gate conservancy. we have learned how to live together at peace with our neighbors. and we have learned how to take better care of the rangelands and our environment. what the conservancy has done for me is huge. i see that it is removing poverty in the community. it is removing blindness through education, and most of all, it has removed cowardice in me.” the nature conservancy, northern rangelands trust, lewa wildlife conservancy, ol pejeta conservancy and local communities are working together on livestock to markets, an innovative program to purchase cattle from pastoralist communities, transport them to quarantine areas with an abundance of grass to fatten them and sell them in nairobi, where they fetch a higher price for their improved size, health and quality. in exchange for higher income, participating communities implement management practices that improve the quality of the range for their cattle and for wildlife. sustainably managed cattle grazing actually improves wildlife habitat since cows will eat tall grass and expose the younger shoots, which wildlife prefer. in the past year, the program provided income for 451 households and benefi ted more than 3,000 people.
