 this year, the conservancy and the university of california press published the atlas of global conservation, the worldâ€™s first comprehensive collection of conservation maps. the book represents a collaboration of some 70 institutions, the work of hundreds of scientists and thousands of hours of research and consolidation of incredibly specialized data. the book includes more than 100 full-color maps and charts of new information, such as where forests are disappearing most rapidly, as well as essays by leading conservation thinkers that put the information in its larger context.
