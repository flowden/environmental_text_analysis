 by far the world’s leading source of low-carbon electricity, hydropower will be a key part of solutions to meet future energy demands. at the same time, hydropower can jeopardize the natural functions of rivers and has contributed to dramatic declines in freshwater species. its projected expansion threatens more such losses. addressing this challenge requires innovative science, new approaches and a willingness by people with diverse interests to partner on solutions. the nature conservancy is working to catalyze this collaboration by quantifying the costs of hydropower expansion, as well as the benefits of a more balanced approach to energy development and rivers. at the 2015 world hydropower congress in beijing in may, we released the power of rivers, a report showing that the global hydropower development levels projected for 2050 would fragment or negatively impact 300,000 kilometers (more than 186,000 miles) of rivers. what’s more, such development would disproportionately affect rivers with the greatest diversity of freshwater species and occur in regions where people depend most directly on rivers for their food and livelihoods. in the power of rivers, we propose an alternative: the opportunity to configure dams to reach energy objectives while minimizing negative environmental and social impacts. doing so could reduce river fragmentation by a third. by arming decision-makers with sound tools and data, we hope to generate better outcomes for people and nature. the potential for better outcomes from hydropower development is great, and the future of our rivers depends on finding innovative solutions to achieve that potential.
