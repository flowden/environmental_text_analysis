 one evening in 1966, a small group of scientists and a lawyer met in a modest living room on long island, ny. the scientists had amassed clear evidence that the pesticide ddt was threatening the survival of magnificent birds of prey like the osprey, but local officials had ignored their appeals. so they did something highly unusual at the time: they went to court on behalf of the environment. ultimately, they won a nationwide ban on ddt. when the lawyer and scientists joined forces that day, it marked a turning point for conservation in america and led to their incorporating environmental defense fund in 1967. we soon strengthened the partnership of science and law by becoming the first u.s. environmental group to hire full-time ph.d. economists, because we recognized that market forces can drive either pollution or progress—and we wanted to harness those forces for good. we also hired mbas and political experts who could turn great ideas into reality. and we forged unlikely alliances—with ranchers, farmers, fishermen, business leaders and officeholders from both sides of the aisle— to create durable solutions. in 50 years, edf has grown from a handful of people on long island to a global force, with staffers working in more than 15 countries and some 1.5 million members from all walks of life. now, as a newly elected u.s. president vows to roll back bedrock environmental protections, we must summon all of our strength to defend them. no single organization can possibly do everything that is needed to address today’s urgent environmental challenges. but by working with partners at every level, we can and do make a lasting difference.
