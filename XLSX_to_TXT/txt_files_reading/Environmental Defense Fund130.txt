 in 2016, edf launched a nationwide effort to save the beloved monarch butterfly, whose populations have declined a staggering 90% in just two decades. a key reason for the monarch’s decline is the loss of its milkweed habitat, a casualty of increased use of agricultural herbicides, climate change and other factors. in response, edf and partners introduced the monarch butterfly habitat exchange, in which farmers can earn credits for conserving and creating monarch habitat. the credits can then be sold through an exchange to the wide array of stakeholders who want to see the monarch recover. under the exchange, it will be more profitable for farmers to protect milkweed than to eliminate it. over the summer, edf scientists traveled the country developing methods to accurately measure the quality of milkweed and nectar plant habitat. “now we can better direct investments for maximum bang for the buck,” says edf director of conservation strategy david wolfe. the monarch’s recovery could make a controversial listing under the endangered species act unnecessary.
