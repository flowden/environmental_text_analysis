 when edf wants to drive change across industries and supply chains, we reach out to major corporations that have the leverage to transform how things are done. it’s been that way since we teamed up with mcdonald’s in 1990—the very first partnership between an environmental group and an industry leader. over the course of a decade, mcdonald’s eliminated more than 300 million pounds of packaging, recycled one million tons of corrugated boxes and reduced restaurant waste by 30%. other restaurant chains quickly followed suit. we accept no funding from corporate partners, freeing us to set aggressive goals and spread innovations across entire industries. in our ten-year partnership with walmart, for example, the world’s largest retailer has delivered leadership in removing hazardous chemicals from tens of thousands of consumer products (see p. 7) and in making a companywide commitment to reduce 20 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from its supply chain. with edf’s help, walmart far exceeded that goal, cutting nearly 36 million metric tons. now walmart has made a new commitment to work with its suppliers to reduce one gigaton of carbon pollution by 2030—more than germany emits in a year. leadership from companies will be essential in demonstrating that we can address climate change while creating shared prosperity.
