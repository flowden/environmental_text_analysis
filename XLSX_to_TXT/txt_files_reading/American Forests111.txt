 it is now widely accepted that human influence is affecting global climate change, and recent research has demonstrated that nearly 60 percent of the worldâ€™s environment is degraded. with more people living in cities (80 percent in the u.s. and 50 percent worldwide), the need for clean air and water has never been greater. fortunately, trees and forests can play a significant role in helping people counteract the negative influences of environmental degradation and can be especially beneficial for cleaning our water and reducing air pollution, including excess carbon dioxide. american forests, through its programs in three centers, helps people assess their forest resources, create better forest policy, and take action to protect, restore, and enhance the natural capital of trees and forests.
