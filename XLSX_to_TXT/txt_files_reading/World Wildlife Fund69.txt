 contamination from toxic chemicals has become all-pervasive. wherever scientists look – the tropics, the oceans, industrial areas, the arctic – they find traces of chemicals and pesticides which alter sexual, neurological, and behavioural development and affect repro- duction and immune systems. and every community – human, plant, and animal – is exposed to them, whether from industrial and urban pollution, agricultural pesticides, or contaminated water or food supplies. around the world, wwf is working with governments, local organizations, and the private sector to reduce or eliminate at least 30 of the world’s most dangerous chemicals and pesticides by 2007, targeting in particular toxic substances which have a long life-span and synthetic chemicals that disrupt hormones in humans and wildlife (see pops and edcs, opposite). by promoting environmentally acceptable, effective, and affordable alternatives to toxic chemicals, wwf is working to make farming practices more sustainable and less destructive of the soil, to reduce the levels of toxics entering natural environments such as fresh- water wetlands, and to improve human health and livelihoods.
