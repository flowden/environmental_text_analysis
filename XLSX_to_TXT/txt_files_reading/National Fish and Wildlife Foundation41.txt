 for the past 11 years, the foundation has worked to protect wild tigers and their habitats throughout their asian range through the save the tiger fund, a partnership with the exxonmobil foundation and other donors. save the tigerâ€™s 2005 strategic plan identified four main threats to wild tiger populations: continued poaching to serve the global demand for tiger parts; habitat destruction; insufficient knowledge of what tigers need to survive in a changing landscape; and the lack of mobilized support for tiger conservation across the public, private and nonprofit sectors. in 2005, the fund invested $1.6 million in 30 projects covering activities ranging from research and monitoring, to anti-poaching and habitat protection. in addition, the fund continued to raise awareness of the need for tiger conservation efforts through public outreach.
