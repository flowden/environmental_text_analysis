 since 1996, wwf’s forest conservation programme has been strengthened by the forests for life campaign, which set two challenging targets: ● establishing a network of protected areas covering at least ten per cent of each of the world’s forest types by the end of 2000. independent certification of at least 25 million hectares of forests as being “well-managed” – that is, sustainably – by june 2001, mainly in key timber-producing countries.
