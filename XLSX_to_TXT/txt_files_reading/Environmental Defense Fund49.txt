 more than 2,000 years ago, the ancestors of stephen roe lewis settled along the fertile banks of arizona’s gila river. in a remarkable feat of engineering, they carved 500 miles of canals out of the sonoran desert and cultivated a broad variety of crops, learning to survive the dry years. in 2019, three southwestern states afflicted by drought turned for help to lewis and the 12,000-member gila river indian community he heads. the tribe’s decision to relinquish some of its water rights for a two-year period helped cement a historic conservation agreement among the three states. from the start, lewis steered negotiations toward stewardship. “drought is a consequence of climate change. we must face the fact that our future will be drier,” he says. “we do not take for granted any drop of water. we’ve lived through it being taken from us.” edf worked closely with the community to craft the deal. we’re now talking with tribal leaders about restoring other river flows. “in its willingness to conserve water, the gila river tribe is an example to all,” says kevin moran, who heads edf’s colorado river program. “we hope people across the southwest will start talking about water the way this tribe has for millennia.”
