 acre for acre, coast-dwelling mangroves store more carbon than almost any other type of forest, locking carbon deep into the mud. a recent study found that the carbon footprint of a steak and shrimp dinner, were it to come from shrimp farms and pasture formerly occupied by mangroves, is the same as driving a small car across the continental united states. mangroves also offer crucial habitat for marine life, provide food and jobs for millions, and buffer coastal communities from storm surges and waves. yet half the world’s mangroves have been lost, releasing their outsized carbon stores into the ocean and atmosphere. in são joão de ponta in northern brazil, with help from google, conservation international is pioneering a novel approach to save a mangrove forest. by working to support a sustainable crab-fishing economy, we are helping to improve local livelihoods while protecting an area of mangroves containing the same amount of carbon as the emissions of 1.5 million cars driving for one year. around the world, ci and partners have protected 6 million hectares (15 million acres) of coastal areas from unsustainable development — an area 10 times the size of everglades national park. this year, we took our ambition to new heights. to reverse the tide of mangrove deforestation, conservation international helped launch the global mangrove alliance, a partnership of ngos and other stakeholders. its aim: stop the destruction of mangroves worldwide and expand their global extent by 20 percent by 2030. by protecting mangroves, we are combating climate change — and improving the well-being of more than 10 million people who are directly dependent on coastal ecosystems for their food, livelihoods and protection from climate change.
