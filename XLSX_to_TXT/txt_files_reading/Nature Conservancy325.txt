 because deforestation produces about 20 percent of the worldâ€™s greenhouse gas emissions, forest conservation must be a key element in any successful climate change strategy. today, forests are considered more valuable for timber, cropland, or pasture than for the amount of carbon they store. financial incentives for reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (redd) would correct this market imbalance by rewarding countries that effectively lower their emissions from forest destruction. countries participating in a redd program would see economic and environmental benefits, along with all the other benefits an intact forest ecosystem provides to local communities.
