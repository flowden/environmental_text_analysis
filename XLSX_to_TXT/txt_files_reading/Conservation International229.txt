 in 2020, we published groundbreaking, policy-relevant research. here are some of the highlights. the farming frontier fields of corn in siberia? soy plantations in the yukon? it’s not as far-fetched as it may seem: a study led by conservation international found that climate change will make it possible in the near future to grow certain crops in places that were once inhospitable to them. the environmental consequences, researchers wrote, “could be catastrophic,” calling for policymakers to heed warnings against developing these areas. wildlife extinctions after a landmark un report revealed that nearly 1 million species are facing extinction, a groundbreaking study led by conservation international offers a solution to save more than half of these doomed species, while slowing climate breakdown: conserve just 30 percent of tropical lands. the study is the first to offer a comprehensive map of the most important natural areas to protect to reduce extinction risk. digging in the dirt our current food system fuels deforestation as countries struggle to keep farming sustainable amid growing demand for food. a study published in march found that the secret to meeting this demand lies in the soil — or more specifically, in the carbon stored in the soil. protecting or restoring the carbon in soils, the scientists found, not only can boost agricultural productivity but can provide 3 billion tons of cost-effective climate mitigation per year.
