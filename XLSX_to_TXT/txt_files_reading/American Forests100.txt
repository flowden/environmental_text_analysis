 the main goal of our forest policy work is to ensure the protection and restoration of forest-based ecosystem services, especially clean air and water. toward that end, we monitored and analyzed legislative proposals related to climate change and forests, and provided commentary on the lieberman-warner climate change bill. we developed and implemented communication strategies for policymakers and the media on climate change and forests, prepared an issue paper as a part of the rural voices for conservation coalition (rvcc), and conducted briefings with agencies and capitol hill staff. we worked with partner s on changing federal forest management, and assisted in developing the forest landscape restoration act. we also worked to advance a “green-collar workforce” in legislative priorities / issue papers. finally, as a part of our effort to ensure that trees and forest are recognized for the unique values they bring to addressing global climate change, we worked with california state parks and the california climate registry to advance a carbon forest project for conoco-phillips. the project, at california’s cuyamaca state park, will be the first forest carbon project under the new protocol.
