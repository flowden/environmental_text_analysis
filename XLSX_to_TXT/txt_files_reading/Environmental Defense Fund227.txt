 the nation’s principal chemicals law, the 1976 toxic substances control act (tsca), hasn’t been updated in 37 years. it imposes such a high burden on proving harm that epa could not even ban asbestos. companies have only had to test about 3% of 85,000 chemicals in commercial use. edf has been pressing for reform since 1997, when we published toxic ignorance, a seminal report that exposed the lack of health data for common chemicals found in everything from baby bottles to household cleaners. voluntary efforts to rein in chemicals of concern are important, but they cannot take the place of strong regulatory standards. edf is making progress there, too. to build support for strong new legislation, we helped found a coalition of 250 health and environmental groups called safer chemicals, healthy families. we’ve since been working with state governments and health, labor, business and consumer groups to make the case for reform. our prodding already has brought results. it pushed epa to upgrade its chemical reporting practices. and in 2013, we helped strengthen and advance a reform bill, introduced by the late senator frank lautenberg (d-nj) and senator david vitter (r-la), that has strong bipartisan support.
