 china, the world’s largest coal consumer and greenhouse gas emitter, is crucial to stabilizing the planet’s climate. edf is engaged at every level helping china solve its environmental challenges. our vp dr. daniel dudek co-chairs the task force advising the chinese government on how to meet the nation’s ambitious environment goals. more than 20 years ago, beijing called on dr. dudek to participate in the country’s first experiments with economic incentives for pollution control. early successes prompted the government to include carbon trading projects in its latest five-year plan. this year beijing, assisted by edf, designated seven cities and regions for pilot carbon trading. compulsory trades start in 2013. the programs aim to reduce carbon emissions in china’s main economic regions. shanghai, for example, will focus on 200 large enterprises in the yangtze river delta. eventually, china plans to establish a nationwide trading system and link with other carbon markets.“we’re helping lay the groundwork to make it happen,” says dr. dudek. edf’s work on carbon markets also helps with poverty reduction—china’s top priority. our partner is the state council’s poverty alleviation office, which has representatives in every community. we’ve created a program where some 500,000 poor farmers in xinjiang, sichuan and shaanxi provinces earn income by reducing carbon emissions, through improved agricultural practices and by turning waste to energy. our goal is to enlist 20 million farm families by 2016. since environmental enforcement remains weak, we helped beijing devise tougher penalties for water pollution. a similar policy is now being developed for air pollution. all these changes will be implemented by a new generation of chinese environmental leaders, many trained through a program edf set up with china’s elite universities. so far nearly 11,000 professionals have graduated.
