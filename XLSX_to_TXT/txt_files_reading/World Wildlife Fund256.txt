 climate change is already fundamentally altering the natural balance of our planet. two centuries of growing carbon emissions from industry, agriculture, transportation and urban living threaten changes that are hard to comprehend: deserts forming in fertile plains, melting icecaps, islands disappearing and coastlines redrawn. we have reached a point in human evolution where protecting our planet and the diversity of life on it requires a concerted global effort, not only to control climate change but also to respond effectively to its already inevitable impacts. the most urgent goal is a drastic reduction in harmful emissions to keep global warming below the critical threshold of 2°c. this is only possible if the nations of the world reach agreement on how it can be accomplished. wwf’s climate change vision: a “climate safe” future in which carbon emissions are reduced by 80 per cent by 2050 and global warming is kept below 2°c. to meet this strategic challenge, wwf national organizations in pivotal countries such as the larger european union member states, the united states, brazil, china and india are working with partners to secure their country’s participation in a “global deal”. they are preparing expert analyses to support the case for participation, and enlisting business and public opinion to help build political will. we are also enlisting the support of business on a global level, urging companies to speak out in favour of an international agreement and to lead by example. business’s capacity to invest and drive technological innovation is essential to meeting the challenges of climate change and sustainable growth that lie ahead.
