 farmers need water to feed people and support local economies. tnc is proving that smarter crop choices in the arid west can provide more water for both people and nature. in arizona’s verde river valley, a commonsense shift on the land has meant big changes where it counts: in the life-giving waters of the verde river. flowing from highlands in central arizona, the 190-mile-long verde and its streamside stands of willow and cottonwood are a wellspring of life. the river also irrigates dryland farms and supplies communities with drinking water. recently, the river has been so over-tapped that sections have run dry during summer, threatening the viability of some farmlands and the survival of a rich diversity of wildlife, including two endangered fish species. to address the problem, tnc, together with local partners in business and farming, proposed a change that seemed capable of doing the impossible: saving precious water while growing marketable crops and inspiring the growth of a new sector in the local economy. in short, tnc worked with the largest farm in the region to switch to barley, which consumes half the water of thirsty crops like alfalfa and corn. and tnc helped support a new company to process the barley for use in beer. in just three years, the shift to high-quality malting barley has been a big hit with local brewers, saved 425 million gallons of water—enough to fill more than 600 olympic-sized swimming pools—and kept the verde river flowing.
