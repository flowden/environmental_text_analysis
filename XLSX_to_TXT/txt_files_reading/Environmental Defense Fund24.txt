 the largest source of u.s. climate pollution is transportation, yet the administration is trying to roll back vehicle pollution standards. some automakers have gone along, but ford, honda, bmw and volkswagen rejected the plan and agreed with california on stronger standards. when the administration then moved to quash california’s authority to set its own standards, edf, its allies and 23 states — including michigan, home of the u.s. auto industry — filed suit in federal court to block the attempt.
