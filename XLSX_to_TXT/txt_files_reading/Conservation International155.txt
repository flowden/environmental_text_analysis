 by 2050, food production will have to increase by 70 percent to meet expected demand. making matters worse, the effects of climate change on crop production are expected to be severe in places already struggling with food shortages â€” partly due to drought, deforestation and unsustainable development that are degrading the productivity of lands. in 2017, conservation international, through a partnership with lund university and nasa, created a land degradation monitoring platform, trends.earth, to employ big data and cloud computing to help users identify degraded areas and to devise locally appropriate measures to address them. the tool is already being applied in four african countries and is rapidly expanding at the request of the united nations convention to combat desertification (unccd). in 2018, trends.earth will be introduced by unccd to the 195 country signatories of the convention as the recommended tool for national-level planning to achieve a land-degradation-neutral world by 2030.
