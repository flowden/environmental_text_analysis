 indigenous people, such as the karuk, yurok and hupa peoples of present-day california, have been practicing controlled and intentional burns for millennia. yet in many developed countries, these cultural fires, and their ecological benefits, largely disappeared by the 20th century often due to policies aimed at suppressing wildfire. the declining health of many forests and grasslands now reveals the long-term costs of removing fire from landscapes that have been shaped by indigenous fire steward- ship. holding back low-intensity fires can lead to bigger—in some cases catastrophic— wildfires that take a toll on human health, harm nature and put communities at risk. through intersecting connections in australia, canada and the united states, tnc is supporting the efforts of indigenous communities to revitalize use of cultural fires in today’s context. in tnc’s north america fire programs, which conduct roughly 600 burns on 100,000 acres every year, we now help facilitate or fund workshops, learning exchanges and community-based trainings that support indigenous communities’ efforts to bring the benefits of cultural burning to people and landscapes alike.
