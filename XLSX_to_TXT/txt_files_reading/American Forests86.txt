 aff, through our network of more than 10,000 grassroots advocates, worked tirelessly in 2011 to get forest conservation and stewardship “on the radar” in the congressional debate over reauthorization of the farm bill. aff built a coalition of more than 80 organizations, ranging from industry to environmental groups, united in the effort to make sure private working forests had a seat at the table in the farm bill debate. our purpose was clear: to improve conservation programs that help family forest owners better manage and steward their land. thanks to aff’s efforts in 2011, we are well-positioned to get the policy changes we’ve fought for as the massive bill moves toward reauthorization. these changes include getting wood recognized in the u.s. department of agriculture’s biobased markets program. by getting these improvements included in the farm bill, our work will help drive federal and consumer markets for wood products.
