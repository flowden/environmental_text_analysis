 the nature conservancy works in all 50 u.s. states, plus two u.s. territories, as well as 27 countries throughout the western hemisphere, asia, the pacific and australia. we work closely with local communities, land trusts, government and non-governmental agencies, multilateral institutions and for-profit organizations, as well as other nonprofit conservation organizations. such broad partnerships enable us to balance human needs with ecological priorities—and accomplish far more than we could by working alone. global conservation partnerships: protecting the world’s biodiversity over the long term requires an effort and investment that is far beyond the scope of any single organization. the conservancy’s 10-year goal calls for the specific protection by the year 2015 of approximately 10 percent of five broad habitats: forests, grasslands, deserts and arid lands, freshwater and marine. this goal aligns the conservancy with the ambitious goal adopted by more than 186 countries through the convention on biological diversity. our success in meeting this goal will be directly tied to working collaboratively with many global partners and local communities.
