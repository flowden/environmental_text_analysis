 each of these developments, occurring over the past several months, is immensely important in its own right. they also are emblematic of the directions in which the conservancy must move if it is to keep ahead of those who would leave earth a lesser place. these projects are on a scale at which we often will need to operate to be truly effective. they involve partners who bring skills and resources that we may not have, and in some cases, control that we cannot muster. by building on our interests and our skills, and by persuading others that we indeed can and do have common interests, more can be done than we ever could achieve alone. on behalf of the conservancy’s dedicated staff, volunteers and partners, i am proud to present this annual report to you. it reflects the increasing impact of our efforts to achieve tangible, lasting results on a large scale—results that come with ever greater cost efficiency. ultimately, it is you, our supporters, who are responsible for these results. i hope you share my pride in what we, together, have been able to accomplish.
