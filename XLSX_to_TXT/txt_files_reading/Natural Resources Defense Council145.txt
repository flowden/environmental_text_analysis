 nrdc filed a lawsuit in january 2014 because the federal government illegally granted the u.s. navy permission to harm marine mammals nearly 10 million times in southern california and hawaii over the next five years. this case is the latest in nrdc’s longstanding campaign to keep our oceans quiet and to curb the navy’s use of sonar and explosives. in its own environmental review, the navy estimates that sonar training, underwater detonations, and gunnery exercises will significantly harm marine mammals 9.6 million times between 2013 and 2018. the navy’s authorization request to the national marine fisheries service sought approval for 155 mortalities, more than 2,000 instances of permanent hearing loss or other permanent injury, and millions of instances of temporary hearing loss or significant disruptions in vital behaviors—a 1,100% increase in projected harm from the previous 5-year period. there are more than 35 species of whales and dolphins that make southern californian and hawaiian waters their home, including endangered blue whales, and fin whales, hearing-sensitive beaked whales, and migrating gray whales. all are at risk from this preventable harm. for whales and dolphins, the navy’s plan to ramp up training off our coasts is simply not sustainable. the science proving the link between sonar exposure and population decline is mounting. and so are the solutions that could prevent thousands of needless injuries and hundreds of deaths. common-sense measures would significantly decrease the harm to california’s and hawaii’s aquatic species. the most important of these is to avoid important habitat for vulnerable species, which the scientific community and the obama administration itself acknowledge to be the most effective available means of protecting marine mammals.
