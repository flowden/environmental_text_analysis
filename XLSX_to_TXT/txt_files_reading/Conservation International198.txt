 imagine you and three friends are 2 inches tall and hitching a ride on a jellyfish drifting in the sea, when a leatherback turtle swoops above your head, chasing down its next meal. as you get closer, you realize the floating translucent object is not a jellyfish — the turtle’s favorite food — but a plastic bag. looking up to the surface, you see sunlight peeking through a thick layer of bottles, containers and other plastic trash. conservation international’s social virtual reality experience, “drop in the ocean,” enables participants to experience the wonders of the ocean — and encounter the plastic pollution that threatens it — from the viewpoint of marine life. made possible by sc johnson, and co-produced by conservation international and vision3 in association with vulcan productions, “drop in the ocean” is narrated by explorers, filmmakers and environmental advocates philippe and ashlan cousteau. after premiering at the tribeca film festival in new york, the experience ran as a pilot at the california academy of sciences in san francisco, was featured at the jackson wild film festival and continues to be shared with attendees at prominent private functions around the world.
