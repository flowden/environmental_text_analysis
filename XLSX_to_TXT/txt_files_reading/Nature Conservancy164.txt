 science for nature and people (snap) brings together scientists, policymakers and practitioners to create and implement real-world solutions to some of the world’s biggest challenges involving nature and human well-being. snap—a collaboration co-founded by the conservancy—has 12 working groups investigating topics such as urban water security, the impact of hydraulic fracturing on water quality, the sustainable management of fish stocks, and the feeding of 9 billion people. solutions based in new scientific analysis emanating from these working groups eventually will be implemented in places around the world, from south america’s pacific fisheries to vulnerable coastal regions of north america and agricultural lands of africa. nature.org/ar-snap
