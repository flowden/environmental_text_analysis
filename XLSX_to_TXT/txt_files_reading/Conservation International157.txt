 research from conservation international is showing that governments are shrinking, loosening or eliminating national parks and other protected areas around the world — most visibly in december 2017, when the trump administration moved to downsize two u.s. national monuments. such moves can disturb and fragment ecosystems, reducing biodiversity and harming habitat health, all while giving other countries the moral license to take similar actions to remove critical protections for areas of key biodiversity around the world. in 2017, the ci community sent over 30,000 comments to the u.s. government in defense of national parks and monuments. in the coming year, new ci research will examine the state of protected-area status on regional, national and global scales, investigating what happens when protected areas are tempered, reduced or eliminated and placing the united states’ recent moves into historic context.
