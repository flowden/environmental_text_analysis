 it’s up to us—those with the ability and financial resources to lead on climate—to do everything in our power to protect future generations. this is the moral imperative that inspires our donors and drives our grant-making. at the un summit, president obama said climate disruption is “the one issue that will define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other.” the world is looking to the united states to lead by example, and so far, solutions championed by the environmental movement in this country are working. good things are happening in the world. with strong support from the sierra club, the obama administration put mandatory limits on carbon sources. an historic u.s.-china agreement brought together the world’s largest economies, energy consumers, and carbon emitters on an issue that affects the entire world. and for the first time in 40 years, global carbon emissions from the energy sector were unchanged in 2014. our job, as environmentalists and philanthropists, is to make investments in the future count and on a scale that can help solve a global crisis and usher in a new clean energy paradigm. our commitment to donors is to fund the most effective work of the sierra club, our partners, and our allies, and use successes to leverage future funding and increased innovation. we steward responsibly, grant strategically, and invest ethically. over the next few years, our challenge will be to ensure that leaders in this country and around the world ignore those who say we can’t move forward, and instead invest in technologies and people that can. this will take unprecedented public will, and funders who are willing to build it.
