 some of our longest-running and most successful conservation partnerships began with a regional focus, but grew over time to achieve national importance. our partnership with altria, for example, began in 2009 as an effort to improve water quality along portions of the companyâ€™s supply chain, but has since expanded to include the chesapeake bay and columbia river watersheds, along with aquatic ecosystems throughout the southeast. conocophillips began working with us two decades ago to advance the conservation of migratory birds, and its support now includes the conservation of a variety of western wildlife species. shell oil company began working with us in 1998 to conserve habitats and species in areas where it operates. over the past two decades, this partnership has grown to include support for conservation programs throughout the nation. in 2005, we began working with walmart to offset its retail footprint by helping to protect an equivalent acreage of natural habitats across the nation. the resulting acres for america program has far surpassed its original goal, having conserved more than 1.6 million acres. nfwf has been working with the william penn foundation for more than 15 years. the partnership has evolved into a strategic priority for both foundations, encompassing the entire delaware river watershed.
