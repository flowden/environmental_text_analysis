 this year, american forests launched tree equity: career pathways, an initiative that seeks to address a massive skilled labor shortage in the urban forestry and tree care sectors. a skilled workforce is fundamental to our mission of growing and sustaining healthy urban forests. and it helps address a critical economic and social justice reality, which is that communities with the highest tree canopy needs generally tend to be those with the highest unemployment; yet public agencies, nonprofit groups and tree- and lawn-care companies are facing a massive skilled labor shortage and struggling to attract and retain workers. our new initiative focuses on connecting unemployed and underemployed communities of color, and other overlooked populations, to green careers. working with forestry employers, american forests is cultivating a qualified and inclusive workforce to sustain healthy cities through resilient urban forests for generations to come.
