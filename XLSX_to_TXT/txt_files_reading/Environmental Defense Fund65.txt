 after years of growth at any cost, a rising middle class in china is demanding a shift to clean, sustainable development. with the united states leaving the paris climate accord, beijing hopes to fill the void in global climate leadership by lessening its dependence on coal and boosting renewables. china, the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, is on track to meet its paris commitments. edf has worked in china for 27 years, initially helping to guide the country’s first projects using economic incentives to cut pollution. more recently, we helped accelerate the blue sky policy that has reduced fine particle pollution in some major cities by 40 percent over the past five years. we’re now advising china as it rolls out what will become the world’s largest carbon market, initially covering 1,700 companies in the power sector. our focus is on transparent data sharing between the ministry of ecology and environment and the china electricity council, a powerful trade association. accountability is key. the ministry includes 43,000 environmental enforcement officers edf helped train through a program we established with leading universities.
