 many of the investments made by nfwf support conservation on private lands, including “working lands” such as farms, ranches, energy extraction sites and timber operations. grants awarded to organizations such as wyoming stock growers land trust, saginaw conservation district and the longleaf alliance ensure that the interests of the business and conservation communities remain tightly aligned. the grasslands found on this ranch in arizona were protected through a conservation easement purchased by the trust for public land and supported by acres for america, a program launched by nfwf and walmart in 2005.
