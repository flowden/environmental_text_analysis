 early in 2013, it wasn’t clear that the obama administration would act to clean up power plants. “we were up against wellfunded interest groups doing all they could to block this,” says carol andress, our climate legislative director. “but direct advocacy with policy makers helped cut through those arguments.” the environmental defense action fund gave legislators on both sides of the aisle the information they needed to support strong power plant standards. the administration moved forward to propose standards, and while the coal lobby is still fighting, the action fund won’t rest until tough standards are made final.
