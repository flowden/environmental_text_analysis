 the american people send representatives to washington, d.c., in order to secure the interests, achieve the goals, and advance the values that define us as a democracy. but recently, our federal leadership has failed to protect our basic human rights to clean air and water, our natural resources and public spaces, and a safe and healthy future. against this backdrop of negligence, nrdc is collaborating with and amplifying the voices of a new—and in some ways unexpected—class of environmental leaders. through shared resources offered by nrdc and our vast array of coalition partners—and the support of our network of three million activists— labor groups, cultural organizations, retailers, farmers, and firefighters are bolstered to take bold actions in pursuit of protecting the health of the public and this planet that we all share.
