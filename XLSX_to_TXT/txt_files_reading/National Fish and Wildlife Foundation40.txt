 in 2005, the foundation invested more than $5.5 million in 73 projects, leveraging an additional $9 million to restore and protect freshwater and saltwater fisheries. targeted species include the western cutthroat trout, brook trout, steelhead, chinook, sockeye and coho salmon. the recovery of salmon near nome, alaska illustrates what can be accomplished with foundation support. sockeye and coho salmon had been severely reduced in number in nome’s glacial and salmon lakes due to over-harvesting. before the project, annual surveys of salmon populations in glacial lake ranged from 300 to 3,000 fish. in 2005, after three years of foundation funding, 11,000 adult sockeye had returned and 65,000 young salmon were counted out-migrating– 20,000 more than any other year of the study. in salmon lake, stocks increased from a pre-project range of 5,000 to 15,000 fi sh to an estimated 56,000 adult sockeye by 2005. the impressive gains were made through public education and enforcement of fi shing regulations with the support of the local community, allowing more fish to return and spawn each year.
