 in the gulf of mexico, the commercial catch share program for red snapper, which edf helped design, has been a huge success. since the program began in 2007, the red snapper population has rebounded. but recreational fishing, which accounts for half the catch, is not part of the program and is poorly managed, leading to overfishing and large discards of fish. edf helped win a legal victory requiring improved management. we also helped launch a two-year pilot catch share program for headboats, or large charter boats, which could be a model for managing recreational fishing. the results are promising, with 20 boats signed up for 2015. member boats are able to take customers fishing year-round under strict catch limits, while those not in the program were only able to fish nine days in 2014.
