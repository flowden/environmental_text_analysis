 on june 23, 2016, when colombia’s government signed a ceasefire with the revolutionary armed forces of colombia, the streets of bogotá churned with celebrations. five months later, after a roller coaster of negotiations, a final accord was approved on november 24. the country’s 52-year-long civil war was over. during the conflict, many of colombia’s natural resources were degraded or destroyed due to overexploitation and poor governance. creating protections to restore those areas and prevent further degradation of the nation’s rich biodiversity and natural capital is essential. the colombian government is working with wwf and other conservation groups to achieve those protections. through heritage colombia, wwf supports a fund to increase the size of the country’s protected areas and ensure their proper management—for the benefit of all colombians.
