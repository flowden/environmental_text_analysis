 in the late 1960s, charles lindbergh and laurance rockefeller persuaded the conservancy to make its first foray into the conservation of tropical forests by preserving a critical portion of the kipahulu valley on maui. to protect the entire valley, the men enlisted the land acquisition expertise of the conservancy. the two spearheaded a fundraising effort for the $1 million that the conservancy needed to purchase upper kipahulu. a 1967 conservancy-sponsored scientific expedition at kipahulu further revealed its ecological importance, helping set the stage for its transfer to the national park service. the conservancy and the state of hawaiâ€™i jointly purchased nearly 5,000 acres and gave them to haleakala national park, creating a wilderness corridor from the rim of the haleakala crater down through tropical rainforest to the pacific ocean.
