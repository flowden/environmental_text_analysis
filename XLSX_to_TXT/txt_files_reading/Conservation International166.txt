 thatâ€™s why conservation international is leveraging our partnership with arizona state university to enlist students to work on our project with nasa (see page 42). by connecting researchers, practitioners and students, we can more rapidly support sustainable landscapes across africa while helping train the next generation of conservation leaders. in the coming years, we will take lessons learned in liberia and repeat them in other countries. through work like this, we have never been closer to proving that when nature is the foundation of development and not the cost of it, we all benefit. our work goes farther when we collaborate.
