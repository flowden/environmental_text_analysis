 vulnerable shoreline habitats along the gulf of mexico bore the brunt of oiling from the deepwater horizon tragedy. ten years later, investments made through the gebf are restoring 60 miles of beach and dune habitat and thousands of acres of enhanced coastal marsh habitat. across the gulf, major projects have focused on increasing the resilience of barrier islands and dune systems, and on improving nearly 3,000 acres of vital coastal habitat. in louisiana, significant gebf investments have aided in completing the restoration of a historic chain of islands that stretch west from the mississippi river to the atchafalaya delta. since 2010, louisiana and partners such as nfwf have allocated nearly $700 million to restore these barrier islands. barrier islands not only serve as a first line of defense against hurricanes, but they also protect the vast coastal marshes that support the game fish, waterfowl, crabs, oysters and shrimp that contribute to the state’s reputation as a “sportman’s paradise.” the latest of these critical barrier island projects commenced construction in 2020, with support from nfwf. the terrebonne basin barrier island and beach nourishment construction project is restoring more than 7 miles along three critical barrier islands within the terrebonne basin barrier shoreline system: west belle headland, timbalier island, and trinity island. an investment of more than $160 million from the gebf is being used to pump more than 9 million cubic yards of sand from offshore to establish more sustainable beach, dune, and marsh habitats in a highly eroded area of the louisiana coast.
