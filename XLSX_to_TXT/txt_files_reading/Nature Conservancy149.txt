 powderhorn ranch, a 17,351-acre mosaic of dense live oak forests, coastal prairies, salt marshes and wetlands , was secured by a partnership between the conservancy, the conservation fund and the texas parks and wildlife foundation. the ranchâ€™s 11 miles of tidal bayfront protect vitally important sea grass beds and mollusk reefs. the national fish and wildlife foundation funded a significant portion of this project using fines from the deepwater horizon oil spill. powderhorn is slated to become a state park with ownership turned over to the texas parks and wildlife department. nearby, half moon reef, a once-massive but now- decimated 100-year-old oyster colony in matagorda bay, is being restored by the conservancy. the 57-acre reconstruction includes niches, caves and passageways that attract not only oysters but also a variety of fish, shellfish and other sea life. it is one of many coordinated reef restoration projects being undertaken across the gulf of mexico from texas to the florida keys. nature.org/ar-gulfcoast
