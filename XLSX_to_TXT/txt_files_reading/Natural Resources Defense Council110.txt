 nrdc took the u.s. navy to court over its high-intensity sonar and explosives training off the coasts of southern california and hawaii, which threatened the well being of more than 60 whale, dolphin. seal, and sea lion populations. in september 2015, following a major legal victory and extensive negotiations, the navy agreed to designate significant habitat in those areas off-limits to such military exercises. the settlement is not the end of the war, however. now nrdc is working to establish sonar-free areas in other marine mammal habitats.
