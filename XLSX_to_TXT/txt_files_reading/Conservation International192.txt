 a sprawling corner of the amazon basin is now protected, thanks in part to conservation international. protected areas are not a novelty in the world’s largest rainforest, but this one had a novel beginning: most protected areas are created only by national governments, but in this case, a local government — using input from local communities — made it happen. with advice and support from conservation international, the bolivian municipality of ixiamas established the bajo madidi municipal conservation and management area in the country’s northwestern region, near the peruvian border. about 40 percent of the new protected area — which at 1.5 million hectares (3.7 million acres) is a bit larger than the state of connecticut — is intact tropical forest, with another 30 percent of the area among the most pristine savanna in the amazon. more than 20 endangered or threatened species of wildlife range there, and the protected area connects adjacent nature reserves to create a massive corridor of protected and indigenous lands in the region. a critical part of conservation international’s climate strategy is centered around increasing the protection of carbon-rich forest in the amazon — for its benefits to nature, climate and communities. conservation international is taking lessons learned from this success to replicate it elsewhere.
