 although large areas of ecuador’s seas are protected, conservation international research has shown that not all protected areas are created equal: adequate funding and staff are necessary to ensure that marine reserves are not “paper parks” — areas that are protected in name only. now, the south american country has millions of reasons for hope for the health of its rich waters. in 2019, conservation international announced the ecuador azul fund, a $6 million endowment fund supporting the conservation, management and long-term sustainability of ecuador’s marine protected areas (mpas). ecuador azul will initially fund five mpas spanning nearly 2,000 square kilometers (about 772 square miles) of diverse marine and coastal ecosystems, containing an enormous range of wildlife, from the world’s largest cluster of manta rays to one of the most extensive mangrove areas along the pacific coast. since 2005, conservation international has helped the country create seven marine protected areas, including four of the five that will initially receive resources from ecuador azul. the long-term goal: a solid financial mechanism to guarantee the effectiveness of all of ecuador’s marine reserves, including any new ones that the country establishes. the pacific waters off the coast of ecuador are part of what is often referred to as “the serengeti of the sea,” a migratory superhighway for scores of iconic marine species, including sharks and whales.
