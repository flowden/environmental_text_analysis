 forests are arguably the most biologically diverse habitats on earth, and home to more than half the world’s species.they are vital because they provide: ● the key to controlling soil erosion and preventing severe flooding ● life-saving drugs and wild relatives of important crops ● energy for cooking and heating in places where no other resource is available ● resources for the timber, pulp, and paper products we use in everyday life ● a source of beauty, recreation, and spiritual values to enrich human existence. yet forests are facing a global crisis. almost half of the planet’s forests have been destroyed in the last 100 years – and the rate is increasing. every minute of every day, we are losing some 26 hectares of forests (roughly the size of 37 football pitches) somewhere in the world due to threats such as illegal logging, land clearance for agriculture, road building, mining, and forest fires. in the year 2000,wwf’s conservation programme included some 300 projects in more than 65 countries to protect and effectively manage key forest areas, restore forests and minimize forest loss, and ensure responsible trade in forest products and services.
