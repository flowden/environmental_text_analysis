 as nrdc trustee jonathan rose says, “with perhaps 10 billion people living on earth by 2050, we are going to have to figure out how to live in ways that are more environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable.” toward that goal, nrdc helped conceive and develop leed for neighborhood development (leed-nd), the first set of consensus- based national standards to steer new development to- ward environmentally sound sites and design. we kicked off our first urban revitalization project in 2011 in the mapleton– fall creek neighborhood of indianapolis. long neglected by private investors reluctant to accept risk, the community suffers from a 50 percent vacancy rate and serious poverty. working with local initiatives support corporation and the neighborhood-based mapleton–fall creek development corporation, we helped construct a pragmatic, achievable vision for mapleton–fall creek that includes affordable housing; access to shops, services, and jobs; transportation options; energy and water efficiency measures; and green storm- water management strategies. the neighborhood is now progressing toward its goal of achieving certification under leed-nd for a 27-acre area. in sites across the country, our revitalization work is engaging local residents to the greatest extent possible in planning and design, applying sophisticated environmental analysis to quantify the benefits we hope to achieve, recording lessons learned along the way, and developing instructional reports and handbooks. the development and planning templates generated by our initiative will help enable community development corporations (cdcs) to apply our strategies in inner-city- neighborhoods nationwide. in an average year, america’s nearly 5,000 cdcs and related community-based nonprofit organizations build some 86,000 homes and millions of square feet of commercial space. we are now exploring opportunities to launch similar demonstration projects in boston and los angeles.
