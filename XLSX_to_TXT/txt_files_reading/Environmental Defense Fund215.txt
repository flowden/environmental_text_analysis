 to stay competitive in the global economy and keep workers engaged, companies are taking a second look at how they use— and sometimes waste—energy. edf has teamed up with the labor union iue-cwa to conduct energy “treasure hunts” at several manufacturing plants. “what’s good for the environment is good for labor—and good for company profits,” says edf project manager brendan fitzsimons. in the future, the union plans to expand the treasure hunts and conduct them at many other workplaces. a key goal: making energy efficiency part of the culture at these plants, not something to think about once or twice a year.
