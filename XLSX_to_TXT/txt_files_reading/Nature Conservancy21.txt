 in 2019, the nature conservancy announced a campaign to increase marine conservation zones around the world by 15% within a decade. but protecting marine resources takes money, and many coastal countries are deeply in debt. in response, tnc launched a financing program called blue bonds for conservation that tackles the problem from both ends. first, tnc arranges the purchase of part of a countryâ€™s national debt, using funds from investment banks. then, simi- lar to refinancing a home, the debt is restructured with more favorable interest rates and longer repayment terms. this in turn frees up funds to pay for national marine conser- vation programs. to be eligible for blue bonds, a country must commit to protecting a portion of its marine areas, with a target of 30%. seychelles is working to finalize a marine protection for an area totaling the size of germany. the conservancy has identified dozens of coastal and island countries with potential for the first round of 20 debt conver- sions. over the next two decades, the program could generate as much as $1.6 billion for marine conservation.
