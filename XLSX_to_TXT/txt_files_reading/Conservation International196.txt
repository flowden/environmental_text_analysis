 day to day, humanity’s dependence on the seas starts with food. three out of seven people worldwide rely on seafood as their primary source of protein — and more than half of all seafood comes from aquaculture, also known as fish farming. yet as crucial as it is for the food security for billions of people, aquaculture can have massive environmental impacts if practiced unsustainably. in such cases, coastal forests are typically the first casualty of aquaculture, cut down for fish farms to expand. the second casualty: the fish, wiped out by disease made worse by water polluted by the fish farms themselves. while good management practices can make fish farming sustainable and curb disease outbreaks, enacting those practices farm-by-farm is impractical. so conservation international is piloting a new approach in east java, indonesia, convening all the players in that region’s shrimpfarming sector — governments, companies, seafood traders and the farmers themselves — in an audacious effort to revolutionize the entire process and avoid the ruinous boom-and-bust cycle of disease that promotes harmful environmental impacts including deforestation. conservation international field staff are now working across the landscape to improve water management, farmer communication and governance while contributing to scientific research. humanity must get aquaculture right — and our new approach could prove to be the first step in getting there.
