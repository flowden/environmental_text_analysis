 the nature conservancy remains rooted in the basic mission and values that have driven us since that first conservation action at mianus river gorge outside new york city. but as our knowledge of nature and how to safeguard it has evolved, and as the world has changed in those 60-plus years, we have stepped up to be as ambitious as our mission requires. protecting the lands and waters on which all life depends demands that we now work bigger, at the scale that nature compels, faster, to outpace the worldâ€™s destructive forces, and smarter, tapping the innovation and technol- ogies that promise solutions in a rapidly changing world. an annual report is an opportunity to stop and assess, but also demonstrate how the past is prologue. in the pages that follow, we hope to inform about the year just completed, but also inspire with a vision of where we are going with your support.
