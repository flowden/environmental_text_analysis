 when a small team of scientists splashed ashore on pulau numfor island in indonesia’s cenderawasih bay national park, their goal was to answer a central conservation question: how can we quantify the relationship between marine protected areas (mpas), marine biodiversity, and the quality of people’s lives? wwf social scientist mike mascia, wwf marine scientist helen fox, papua state university professor fitry pakiding and other partners are answering that question right now. mascia trained dr. pakiding’s team, which traveled between islands and over jungle passes to reach remote villages. they negotiated with local leaders to gain house-by-house invitations, and conducted in-depth interviews that revealed the reality of local people’s health, economic well-being, education, political engagement and cultural connection to their landscape. the study breaks new ground by scientifically comparing social factors between communities with or without mpas, making the links between marine biodiversity and human well-being clear.
