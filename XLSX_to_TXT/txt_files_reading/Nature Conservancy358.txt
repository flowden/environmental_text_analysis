 the two million citizens of quito, ecuador, derive 80 percent of their drinking water from the condor bioreserve—a 5.4-million-acre mosaic of protected areas high in the ecuadorian andes. in 2000, the conservancy made an initial investment of just $1,000 and teamed up with the u.s. agency for international development to develop a fund called fonag for the ongoing protection of quito’s water supply. quito’s water and electric companies contribute to fonag every month, and the fund now contains nearly $5 million. proceeds fund education and reforestation projects undertaken by traditional communities like oyacachi, located within the condor bioreserve. the conservancy has helped establish similar funds in three other south american cities and seeks to replicate the model on a global scale.
