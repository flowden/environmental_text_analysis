 while the balkans are home to many of europe’s last free-flowing rivers, the region has become a target in recent years for plans to develop new hydro dams and other water projects. despite the threats, the nature conservancy's efforts in the region last year helped protect two rivers: the turquoise blue waters of montenegro’s zeta river and, to the north, the krupa river in croatia, which winds through steep and rocky canyons. the two governments protected the rivers using the nature conservancy's new community- focused approach to river conservation known as the durable river protection framework. modeled on the u.s. wild and scenic rivers act, the framework brings new policy approaches that can support freshwater protections around the world. this is critical because rivers hold much of the world’s biodiversity but are, astonishingly, the least protected of the earth’s natural systems. the success in the balkans will help support adoption of the framework in other countries as well.
