 more than 70% of land in the united states is in private hands, and much of it is vital to conserving and restoring healthy populations of wildlife. the foundation supports creative, incentive-based projects to aid farmers, ranchers and other landowners in conserving valuable wetlands, riparian areas, native grasslands, and forests, while sustaining their livelihoods. in 2005, the foundation invested more than $3.8 million, leveraging another $9.5 million in matching funds, in 58 projects to improve conservation practices on private lands. in texas, ranch owners helped conserve black-capped vireo and bobwhite quail habitat and implemented native plant restoration practices. in the midwest and great plains, farm owners protected and restored wildlife-rich prairie potholes, riparian areas and native grasslands critical to migratory birds. in the pacifi c northwest, the foundation supported innovative grassroots strategies to improve stream and river fl ows in the columbia basin to provide water for both fi sh and farmers. funding partners for these initiatives included the natural resources conservation service, the strachan donnelley family trust, the mcknight foundation, the u.s. fish and wildlife service and the bonneville power administration.
