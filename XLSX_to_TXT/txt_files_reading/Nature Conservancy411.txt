 in the long shadow of the rocky mountains, the rivers and valleys that make up the 10-million-acre crown of the continent are home to ranchers and grizzly bears alike. journalist and explorer george grinnell first gave this rugged and remote area its name in the late 1800s. the region extends from the blackfoot river in montana, along the spine of the rockies, past the jagged peaks of glacier national park and into the giant black cotton- wood forests of canadaâ€™s elk river valley. large, unbroken ranches that existed for generations in the region are disappearing as rapid development spreads across the west, cutting off crucial wildlife corridors for migrating animals.
