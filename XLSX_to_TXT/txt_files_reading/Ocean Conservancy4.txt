 in the past, fighting climate change has largely over- looked the impacts of climate change on the ocean and the role of the ocean in climate solutions. that is changing, and ocean conservancyâ€™s advocacy is at the heart of the transformation. during annual global climate negotiations (cop25), we worked with countries to create the first section on ocean-climate action in a cop decision. we also worked with coalitions to set ambitious ocean-climate goals; this included launching the pacific rim ocean-climate action partnership with california, fiji, costa rica and others, and releasing a guide to action from u.s. states. before the cop, we led a knowledge exchange on ocean acidification among u.s. and chilean scientists and shellfish growers, given that carbon pollution drives acidification, and we worked with more than 80 countries to develop guidance for making ocean-smart climate commitments. at home, our testimony in house hearings informed the climate action now act, the first climate legislation passed by the house in 10 years, and we advanced the passage of four house bills addressing ocean acidification.
