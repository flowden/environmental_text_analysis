 st. martin island (left), one of the larger islands in the grand traverse island chain in lake michigan, was protected through the generosity of the fred luber family of milwaukee. the conservancyâ€™s wisconsin and michigan chapters worked with the luber family to acquire this critical stopover for birds that migrate through the great lakes each spring. more than 100 species of birds like the blackburnian warbler (above), as well as migrating bats, butterflies and dragonflies, have been documented using the almost entirely forested island in recent years. the conservancy plans to eventually transfer the land to the u.s. fish and wildlife service to add to the multi- island green bay national wildlife refuge. acquisition of high-value conservation lands, including islands, is just one of a growing set of strategies the conservancy is employing to ensure the future health of the great lakes region and the life it supports. nature.org/ar-great lakes
