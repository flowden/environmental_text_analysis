 launched in 1995, the internship program for city youth is a partnership between the conservancy and the friends of the high school for environmental studies and the brooklyn academy of science and the environment. students work with trained mentors for a four-week field season in july, during which they leave new york city to work on nature preserves. most of these urban students have never had the opportunity to connect with the natural world. conservancy staff teach the students to assist with land management, educational outreach and scientific research in a safe and supervised natural environment. the students maintain contact with conservancy staff and our partners, who provide college and career guidance, along with alumni meetings, classroom presentations and additional internship opportunities.
