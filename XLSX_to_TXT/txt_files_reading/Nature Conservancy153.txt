 using satellite images and data crowdsourced from ebird.org, nature conservancy scientists mapped when and where migratory birds, including sandhill cranes (above), need habitat in californiaâ€™s central valley. a conservancy team, including an economist, then implemented a first-of-its-kind auction to rent and flood farm fields at the exact time and location needed by the birds. the pilot was a success, with more than 40 participating farms creating 10,000 additional acres of wetland habitat at a critical time for migratory birds. the program will be expanded next year. nature.org/ar-california
