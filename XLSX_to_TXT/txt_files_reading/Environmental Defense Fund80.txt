 as water supplies dwindle in the arid west, farmers and water managers are looking for dramatically more efficient ways to use water. the question, according to nevada farmer denise moyle, is, “how do i cut my water consumption by 50 percent over the next 30 years and still manage to grow a crop of alfalfa?” one challenge is that many farmers don’t have access to data on evapotranspiration, or et, a measure of the water they lose to the atmosphere through evaporation from the soil and transpiration through the leaves of plants. by understanding et, farmers have the power to cut down on excess water use while maintaining healthy crops. that’s why edf is working with nasa, the desert research institute and others on openet, a web-based service that will harvest et data from satellites and provide the results to farmers and water managers—nearly in real time. the data will help foster sustainable water use and encourage beneficial water trading programs. “if you give farmers better information on when they should and shouldn’t have their water on, you’re going to save water,” says moyle. “i think that’s the greatest asset of openet.”
