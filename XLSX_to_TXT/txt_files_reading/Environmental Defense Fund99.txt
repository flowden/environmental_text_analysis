 better monitoring of air quality is vital if we are to reduce air pollution that affects billions of people worldwide. but monitors are sparse, with less than a handful in many u.s. urban areas. so, edf asked, how can we measure pollutants and get an accurate picture block by block? joining forces with google earth outreach, we deployed google street view cars equipped with pollution sensors in oakland, ca, a port city with heavy freeway traffic. this allowed us to measure air pollution at street level instead of with typical rooftop monitors. over a year, the cars combed the 78-square-mile study area, taking readings every 30 meters to obtain three million measurements of pollutants such as nitric oxide. the results identified hotspots that varied greatly from block to block. in parts of the city, pollution levels were eight times higher than in others. we’re now expanding the project to houston. “this new method makes invisible threats visible, so communities and policymakers can identify sources of pollution and take action,” says edf chief scientist dr. steven hamburg.
