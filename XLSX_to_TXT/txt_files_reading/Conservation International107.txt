 the tropical ecology assessment and monitoring (team) network is an innovative partnership between conservation international, the wildlife conservation society and the smithsonian institution with the goal of better understanding how tropical forests are responding to a changing climate and disturbed landscapes. team monitors more than 100 vegetation plots and almost 300 species of mammals and birds across 17 protected areas in africa, asia and latin america. data collected from team sites are analyzed and made publicly available in near real time to provide data-driven insights for protected-area managers.
