 effective solutions to climate change will require powerful public policy decisions. with decades of on-the-ground experience in more than 30 countries, the conservancy has become a go-to source for practical and science-based climate policy solutions. this year, the conservancy worked with u.s. and international leaders, building support for an international climate change agreement that would reduce the impact of climate change. the conservancy also advocated for the agreement to enable developing countries to reduce emissions from deforestation through redd schemes, and for funding to implement nature-based adaptation strategies to help protect people from the impacts of climate change.
