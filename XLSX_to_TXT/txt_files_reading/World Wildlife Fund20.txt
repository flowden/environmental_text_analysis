 thousands of species of plants and animals are under increasing threat.every day, added pressures such as loss of habitat, illegal trade, over-hunting, pollution, and the effects of climate change and economic development take their toll on the world’s wildlife and wildlands. ● some 34,000 plant species, or 12.5 per cent of the world’s flora, face extinction. ● giant pandas have lost half their habitat in the past few decades. ● the world lost more than 90 per cent of its tiger population in the 20th century; only about 5,000 remain. ● in the pacific, leatherback turtles face extinction. ● javan and northern white rhinos are the most threatened large mammals on earth:only a few dozen remain. wwf has been combating such negative trends for nearly four decades. the organization focuses particular attention on a small number of globally important “flagship species”: the giant panda, tiger, marine turtles, great apes, great whales, and elephants and rhinos in both asia and africa. these charismatic creatures inspire conservation efforts for themselves – and for the thousands of lesser known, but vitally important, plants and animals with which they coexist.
