 the ranchers soon found that their vision of seamless, sound borderlands was compatible with the aims of unlikely allies: conservationists looking to save one of north america’s last great places. in 1993, the nature conservancy offered its support to what would become the malpai borderlands group, a nine-member nonprofit named for the ranch where members held their first meetings. today, the million acres that constitute the malpai borderlands include the magnificent gray ranch in new mexico, a former conservancy project and one of the richest natural habitats in the united states. what began as a conversation between like-minded ranchers and scientists has grown into a major conservation force, generating innovative solutions that combine science with old- fashioned collaboration. permanent easements protect malpai members’ land from subdivision and ensure habitat for wildlife. a “grassbank” enables ranchers to graze their herds while their own land, depleted by drought, rests and replenishes itself. malpai also is conducting experiments that explore age-old ranching questions: are cattle a blight upon the land, or, like the bison before them, a contributor to grassland renewal? can fire prevent mesquite and other heavy shrub growth from overtaking natural grasses? and can cattle and prairie dogs, living symbiotically, help keep pastures healthy?
