 in southern mexico, we have done just that. working with national and local governments, conservation international helped develop plans for the use and protection of land in chiapas and oaxaca that will result in more than 25,000 hectares (64,000 acres) of land being placed under conservation. meanwhile, we worked to ensure access to markets for sustainably produced agricultural goods with local retailers. green corner (an organic specialty grocery store based in mexico city) has committed to purchase fish fillets, organic cashews, organic cheese and meat products from local smallscale producers. in a region long known for its culture and cuisine, we’re helping people see that sustainability is critical to their future. one of conservation international’s main goals: help people and nature thrive in the same place, together, by building self-sustaining, scalable development models built on conservation.
