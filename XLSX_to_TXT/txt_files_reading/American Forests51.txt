 matching or exceeding our 2013 goal, we will plant more than 2 million trees in 20 or more forest restoration projects, addressing high-impact issues including water resources, fire restoration, wildlife habitat, threats due to insects and disease, climate change and public recreation. ÔÅµ in the greater yellowstone area, we will work with our partners to plant at least 25,000 whitebark pine trees. we will also engage volunteers to distribute pheromone patches, protecting disease-resistant white- bark pines from the damage of bark beetles. we will complete strategic urban forest restoration in the five cities we assessed in 2013 and add at least three additional cities to the community releaf program. we will publish the big tree handbook, implementing the results of the big tree working groups in establishing clear measuring guidelines for public and state programs and groups. we will encourage and assist our members and concerned citizens in sending thousands of letters to congress and federal agencies on critical forest protection and restoration issues and to advocate for sufficient funding to support forests. we will engage communities across the u.s. to advocate for their urban forests and educate elected officials on the importance of trees.
