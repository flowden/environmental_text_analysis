 i’ve been in conservation for 30 years, and i’ve never seen as much excitement to restore our forests as i have in the last 12 months. a swelling movement to unleash the power of trees to help heal the environment and our economy has made 2020 truly the year of the tree. it might be a surprising name, given the overwhelming challenges that have dominated the news and our lives this year. and yet, thanks to you, the power of trees has resonated like never before. because of you, american forests is leading this movement in diverse and powerful ways. we’re using science to devise better ways to plant trees in a changing climate. thanks to you, we’re developing new career pathways into urban forestry for people in under-resourced communities, and leading robust partnerships to reforest cities and large forest landscapes. your support has also helped enact sweeping public policies that invest in our forests. and your values have inspired us to reach further. this summer, we embarked on a bold journey to create the most diverse and inclusive forest movement in american history. our goal: to conserve, restore and grow 1 trillion trees worldwide by 2030. along with the world economic forum, we launched the u.s. chapter of 1t.org, bringing together 28 partners who pledged 855 million trees and billions of dollars to support related innovation, such as climate financing and technology. joining us are cities pursuing tree equity, companies partnering with nonprofits to reforest large landscapes, and civic leaders who are mobilizing individuals and communities to plant trees. you helped build a tent big enough for everyone, no matter how large or small their contributions. thank you for your generous support for american forests. with you, we head into 2021 confident we can create change on a scale never thought possible.
