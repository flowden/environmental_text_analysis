 the conservancy launched liquid courage, an interactive digital platform to activate the next generation of conservationists and to raise awareness about the water challenges we face and the practical solutions we can enact for a more sustainable future. the site seeks to engage u.s.-based urban millennials (roughly, people aged 18 to 30) in global and local water issues. in its first month, the site and accompanying social media campaign reached a potential audience of 4.2 million people and received more than 2,800 social media mentions. millennials represent 130 million people in the united states. water.nature.org
