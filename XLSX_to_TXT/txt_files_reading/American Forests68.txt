 the kootenai valley provides winter range for big-game, as well as habitat for rare caribou, bull trout, burbot, grizzly bear, and lynx. virtually all of the wildlife species that were present at the time of columbus are still present. thinning treatments are providing commercial timber and biomass opportunities, while controlled burns are reducing the risk of damaging mega-fires, improving water quality, enhancing wildlife habitat, and addressing insect infestation across the 39,430 acre cflr project area. for all of his 56 years dan dinning has lived in boundary county, idaho. his earliest memories are of fishing and hunting with his grandfather and father in the hall mountain area. all of his life has been spent enjoying the outdoors with his family, especially in the selkirk mountains. dan still lives in boundary county and is working to keep those memories alive as a county commissioner. “i became a commissioner to help the community maintain and grow the natural resource jobs that the lands provide, while seeking to restore health of the landscape.” dan is a strong supporter of the kootenai valley resource initiative cflr, and has been engaged in the effort to restore the forest for over 12 years. “the project is a critical tool for us to maintain our way of life here in boundary county. it is putting people to work, improving water quality, habitat, and forest health. this is being accomplished with our kootenai valley resource initiative group.” dan adds, “it is my hope that my children, and many future generations will reap the benefit of what we are doing today, that they may share this place with their own families just as i have been able to do.”
