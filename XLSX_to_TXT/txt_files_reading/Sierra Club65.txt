 center for community change (ccc) elevates voices of low-income people, particularly communities of color, to improve their communities and help shape the policies that affect their lives. ccc believes that those most affected by economic and social injustices are best equipped to identify what change is necessary and to make it happen. after the 2016 election, ccc has worked to broaden the tent of allies working on immigration justice issues with new organizations, including social justice allies that focus on other issues. this has transformed public engagement on the immigration reform landscape. the sierra club’s partnership this past year has helped with organizing, like driving thousands to attend rallies, and lent valuable resources in support of ccc efforts—most recently working on behalf of immigrant youth after their daca status was eliminated.
