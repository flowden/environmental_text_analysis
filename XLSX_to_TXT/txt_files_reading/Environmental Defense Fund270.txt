 every year, many new yorkers die because of the dirty heating oil burned in some of the city’s buildings. an edf campaign to end the use of the dirtiest fuels is helping to clear the air. three years ago, edf began a campaign to rid new york city of dirty no. 6 and no. 4 heating oils. just 1% of the city’s buildings burn these fuels—which are basically unrefined sludge—but they spew more particulate matter, or soot, into the air than all the city’s cars and trucks combined. the result: 120 preventable deaths each year and millions of dollars in added health care costs. in 2011, our campaign, which included an interactive online map showing 9,500 city buildings that burn dirty oil, helped convince mayor michael bloomberg to create a clean heat partnership between his administration and edf. the partnership is dedicated to converting buildings from dirty oil. the administration issued rules that will phase out no. 6 oil by 2015 and no. 4 oil by 2030 and announced more than $100 million in mostly private financing to help buildings convert to cleaner fuels. the impact of that decision on illnesses such as asthma and heart disease could be “second only to our achievements in reducing the city’s smoking rates,” said dr. thomas farley, the city’s health commissioner. thanks to nyc clean heat, more than 1,100 buildings already have converted and hundreds more are on track to do so in 2013. they include 257 park avenue south, home to edf’s national headquarters. our sustainability council, charged with reducing edf’s environmental impact, initiated the coming shift. in addition, the investment principles behind clean heat have applications that extend far beyond new york and heating oil. they also apply to investments in energy efficiency. “we’ll be demonstrating to the financial community that energy efficiency is a good investment,” says andy darrell, edf’s new york regional director. “and our model can be adapted to finance efficiency around the world.”
