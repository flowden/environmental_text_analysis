 last year, when i agreed to chair the nature conservancy, i said that i aimed to support our mission with conscience, passion and soul. what brought me here was my work as a telecommunications entrepreneur. but what made me want to serve in this capacity was my love of the natural world. i suspect that’s why all of us are here, whether trustees, team members or donors: we all share this passion, this connection to nature. the nature conservancy has been described as pragmatic, nonconfrontational and nonpartisan in its methods. these descriptions might imply a dispassionate approach, and that image is one of the inconsistencies i grapple with in my role as a leader here. it is true that we rely heavily on science, and our decisions are determined more by rational thinking than by emotions. it is also true that we try to bring everyone to the table—the already-committed alongside those with a less-than-stellar environmental past. what transcends it all, however, is our sacred duty to protect the earth’s ecosystem with all the passion we can muster. the process of working with others to find simple solutions to seemingly intractable problems is a great joy to me, and i celebrate win-win solutions. we at tnc want to help people achieve economic progress, while working hand-in-hand to protect and sustain clean air, pure water, and a healthy planet for future generations.
