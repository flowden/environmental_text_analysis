 american forests is the official publication and the main voice and vehicle of the american forestry association. this monthly full color, 64-page magazine is noted for its ability to address natural resource issues squarely and fairly presenting differing opinions whenever possible, and for its coffee table quality covers and inside illustrations. american forests expresses the policies and goals of the association, and also educates, entertains, and serves as a forum and feedback mechanism for its members. as the association adopted a more action-oriented outreach in 1984, the magazine’s content was stepped up accordingly. such issues as soil erosion, the water crisis, and forest recreation received in-depth coverage. a six-part series dealt with the impact of air pollution on forest health, and stirred a flurry of letters from readers who had different viewpoints to share on this complex issue. new programs like the touch america project (tap) were publicized broadly and a new “afa action" column tells how afa is working for its members in washington, d.c., and across the nation.
