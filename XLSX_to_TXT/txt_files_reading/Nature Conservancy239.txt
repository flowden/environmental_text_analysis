 the introduction of asian carp poses a threat to u.s. lakes and rivers because, due to their large size and voracious appetites, they could significantly disrupt the food chain. the conservancy and the university of notre dame have developed an innovative new method to detect the presence of this invasive species: capturing and amplifying dna sloughed off by fish to identify bighead and silver carp. this early detection method could help prevent the establishment of a self-sustaining population. the method was proven effective after the capture of a carp in illinoisâ€™ lake calumet.
