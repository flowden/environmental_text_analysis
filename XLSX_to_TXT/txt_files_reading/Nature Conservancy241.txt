 paragominas, a municipality in the brazilian state of pará, recently became the first municipality to come off the government’s blacklist of deforesters, a designation that results in commercial embargoes and credit restrictions for rural farmers. with the conservancy’s help, the municipality met the two requirements to be taken off the list: dramatically reducing deforestation and registering more than 80 percent of its territory in the farmland environmental registry (car). other brazilian municipalities are now looking to the paragominas model to control deforestation, and several will be working with the conservancy to develop more forest-friendly ranching practices and economic alternatives.
