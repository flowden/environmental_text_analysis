 deforestation and forest degradation account for about 15% of global carbon dioxide emissions, so protecting tropical forests offers one of the biggest immediate opportunities for reducing emissions. in brazil, which contains one-quarter of the world’s rainforests, edf has been working with state governments and indigenous communities to ensure that preserving forests—and the carbon they store—is more valuable than clearing the land for farming. impressively, brazil has reduced deforestation by more than 70% since 2004. the government was able to put the brakes on large-scale slashing and burning in large part because it recognized indigenous peoples’ land rights and created protected areas that cover roughly 40% of the amazon. recently, however, there’s been political instability and an uptick in deforestation. in response, edf is finding other ways to drive progress. for example, we’re working with major companies such as mcdonald’s to demand that production of commodities like soy, beef and timber leave forests intact.
