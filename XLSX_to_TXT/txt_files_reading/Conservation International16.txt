 indigenous peoples—the stewards of our lands and waters—are key to protecting the planet. in july 2011, ci and our partners announced the first-ever trust fund dedicated to the long-term support of indigenous peoples in brazil. through funding and technical support from the global conservation fund and ci-brazil, the kayapó trust will support the kayapó peoples in the protection of their rights and territory and, at the same time, will help prevent deforestation, one of the primary drivers of global climate change.
