 the amazon basin houses the largest remaining tropical rainforest on earth. it harbors about one-fourth of the planet’s species and stores vast amounts of carbon. but the region faces relentless pressure on its resources. to address these pressures, the conservancy is working in the amazon to help farmers comply with brazil’s advanced forest code, which requires farmers in the amazon to keep 80 percent of their land in native vegetation cover. we also work with indigenous groups, whose territories comprise more than 20 percent of the basin, to help build their capacity in land management. together, these strategies have the potential to protect more than 160 million acres of the amazon and promote a sustainable future for its people.
