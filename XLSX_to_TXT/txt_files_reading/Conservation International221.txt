 under the paris agreement, every country must enumerate its responsibility to help curb climate change through nationally determined contributions (ndcs). conservation international has worked closely with the liberian government to incorporate nature into its ndcs. in addition to clean energy commitments, liberia’s most recent update includes tremendous gains in the agriculture, forestry, fisheries and coastal sectors. and the international civil aviation organization (icao) — an agency of the un that sets global aviation standards — approved a plan to help airlines neutralize their carbon footprint by protecting nature. aviation remains one of the world’s top carbon-emitting sectors, and this announcement can help to compensate for the emissions generated by international flights. conservation international helped to make this happen, engaging policymakers on the creation of a market for airlines to purchase forest-based carbon credits from approved programs. if given final approval, this market has the potential to generate $5 billion in revenue over 15 years. conservation international scored two significant wins in the national and international policy arenas.
