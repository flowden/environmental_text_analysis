 “unsustainable fishing, insensitive coastal development, pollution, and climate change are threatening the health of seas around the globe, putting at risk people’s livelihoods, local economies, and future food supplies. only a tiny fraction – less than 1 per cent – of the earth’s seas are fully protected from exploitation. moreover, the majority of these marine protected areas are not yet adequately managed. to address the threats facing the marine environment, wwf’s endangered seas programme is focusing on industry. whilst indus- tries are not all necessarily bad, they may have different priorities and not always take into account their full impact on the environment. wwf aims to move conservation to the forefront of their agenda. wwf will promote wise-use policies and influence decisions affecting marine resources by creating new market incentives and penalties, influencing legislation and leadership, and applying pressure where appropriate. wwf will encourage industries, particularly those concerned with fishing, petroleum, tourism, shipping, aquaculture, the investment sector, and polluting land-based activities, to adopt practices which are both profitable for business and beneficial to the marine environment. by creating a “ripple effect” that will engage new partners and provide greater momentum in the battle to conserve and restore our seas, wwf can turn the tide on the escalating degradation.”
