 as coastal areas around the world face rising seas and stronger storms fueled by global warming, louisiana is already confronting the consequences. the state’s exquisite marshes and wetlands — already weakened by the extensive construction of levees for flood control and canals for energy exploration — are disappearing at the rate of a football field every 100 minutes. without action, 10,000 homes could be lost. edf is working with a coalition of nonprofits on a $50 billion state plan to rebuild coastal wetlands and help communities prepare for the future. so far, the plan has seen the construction of 60 miles of barrier islands and nearly 300 miles of levee improvements, helping to protect more than 40,000 acres of land. sediment diversions, which help sustain and build land over time, are currently being designed. at the same time, we’ve worked with local partners to give a voice to people whose homes and jobs are under threat. over the course of 71 community meetings, nearly 3,000 louisiana residents drew up proposals to confront the risks they face. the proposals, ranging from floodproofing to an expansion of mental health services, were adopted in full by the state. announcing the investment of more than $41 million, gov. john bel edwards said, “this project offers a model for climate-vulnerable communities everywhere.” applying these lessons, edf is helping other coastal states from new york to texas prepare for the future.
