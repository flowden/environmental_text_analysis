 the mesoamerican reef—the largest barrier reef in the western hemisphere—hugs the belize coast and supports 500 species of fish. many belizians are dependent on the reef for their survival, but overfishing has taken a toll. edf teamed up with the wildlife conservation society and local partners, enlisting fishermen and influential policy makers to preserve this extraordinary reef. under our program, local fishermen have exclusive rights to fish in a designated area, which thrives because of a nearby marine protected area. they are required to record their catch, and many are monitoring illegal fishing, a huge problem. after two years, fishermen themselves are enforcing the rules and illegal fishing is down by more than 60%, allowing them to safely increase their catch. the success has led the government of belize to ask edf’s help to roll out the system nationwide.
