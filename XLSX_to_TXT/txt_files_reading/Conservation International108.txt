 conservation cannot succeed unless everyone is in it together — that’s why partnerships with businesses and communities are such a crucial part of what we do. conservation international collaborates with businesses to demonstrate that protecting the planet is good for the bottom line. we empower people closest to the forests, grasslands and coastlines that benefit us all, directing an average of 30 percent of our funds to communities. engaging with businesses and communities has enabled ci to have a far greater impact than we would on our own, and 2015 saw our partnerships achieve concrete results around the world. the stories on the following pages highlight just a few of our biggest successes of the past year. our partnerships are built into what we do. on the business side, ci’s center for environmental leadership in business helps companies minimize their environmental impacts. as more companies embrace sustainability, ci continues to help them meet growing global demands for food, water and energy in ways that are good for people and for the planet. member companies of ci’s business and sustainability council — established in 2003 as a forum for corporate leaders taking positive environmental actions in their businesses — have an employee base of 5.6 million people. on the community side, the critical ecosystem partnership fund (cepf) — a joint initiative of conservation international and six other partners — extends our reach to civil society around the world. since 2000, cepf has awarded more than us$ 192 million in grants to more than 2,000 organizations and individuals in 92 countries and territories, securing us$ 347 million in additional funds from other donors.
