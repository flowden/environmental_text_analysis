 while most countries deal with water crises when they arise, on june 5th mexico took the long view by establishing 300 new water reserves. this system—which wwf played an instrumental role in developing—sets aside 55% of the country’s surface water, ensuring water supplies for 45 million people over the next 50 years and positively impacting several river basins. this includes the usumacinta, one of mexico’s last free-flowing rivers, which snakes through almost 600 miles of southern mexico, supporting an array of plant and animal species, including jaguars. now, 95% of the river’s volume is allocated to nature. to demonstrate the value of all rivers, wwf also developed an augmented reality app. released in march 2018, the wwf free rivers app uses a virtual landscape and interactive storytelling to show users how people, wildlife, and landscapes depend on healthy, free-flowing rivers. the app has been downloaded over a half million times.
