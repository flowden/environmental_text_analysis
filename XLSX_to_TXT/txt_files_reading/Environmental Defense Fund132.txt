 louisiana’s coast is home to nearly two million people, provides vital habitat for wildlife and contributes enormously to the national economy. but the state is vulnerable to storm damage, in part because of the ongoing loss of coastal wetlands that once buffered the force of storms. every hour, a football field of marshland erodes into open water. without bold action, louisiana’s coast will continue to disappear, putting people, wildlife and industries at risk. now, powered by billions of dollars that bp agreed to pay in damages for the 2010 oil disaster, louisiana is embarking on the largest coastal restoration project ever attempted. the money will help fund the coastal master plan, the state’s blueprint for coastal restoration and protection efforts, which edf helped create. for example, by diverting sediment-rich mississippi river water to the surrounding wetlands, we can help save the delta from collapse. this massive project will rebuild the coastline and revitalize struggling communities. the lessons learned here will help other regions that face rising seas and extreme storms.
