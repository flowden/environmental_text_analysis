 the conservancy is a leader in developing conservation projects that benefit the climate by storing carbon in tropical forests. in places like belize, bolivia and brazil, u.s. companies—including general motors, american electric power and texaco—have invested in these forest carbon projects in order to offset their carbon emissions. building upon our continued forest conservation and restoration work on the ground, the conservancy is working with partners to lay the groundwork for a global market that invests in the carbon stored in tropical forests. such a market has the potential to channel unprecedented funding toward the protection of forests—bringing benefits to plants, animals, local communities and the climate.
