 larger than california, colorado and new mexico combined, northern australia is one of our planet’s last great wildernesses. today, this area is threatened by development, unsustainable ranching, wildfires, mining and invasive species. the nature conservancy is playing a catalytic role in building partnerships throughout australia’s public and private sectors to accelerate conservation on a landscape scale. the conservancy is supporting like-minded partner organizations to acquire private lands that connect existing protected areas and recently joined with the pew charitable trusts, the australian federal government and indigenous landholders to establish two new indigenous protected areas that together span 5 million acres.
