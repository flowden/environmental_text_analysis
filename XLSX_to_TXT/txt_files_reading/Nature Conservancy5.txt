 the worldâ€™s biodiversity is under threat. the rate of extinctions is on the rise and climate change is now exacerbating the threats. declining biodiversity will have real impacts for people, such as threatening clean-water supplies and limiting food sources. for example, threats to pollinators could lead to a costly drop in agricultural output estimated at $217 billion annually. a new paper, financing nature, published by the paulson institute, cornell university and tnc, outlines transformations in policy and finance regulations that would unleash new private-sector investments capable of protecting nature and biodiversity.
