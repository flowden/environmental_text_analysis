 as a kid growing up in kansas, hillerie patton remembers learning “this land is your land” in first grade. even as an adult, said the former employee of the bureau of land management and resident of north las vegas, “when i go out on the public lands, i always think of that song. and whether you’re in maine or michigan or new mexico or nevada, it’s important that all of us take an active interest in making sure that these areas are here for all of us to enjoy.” our public lands and waters have come under direct assault by a federal administration that values them only for their oil, coal, gas, timber, minerals, and prospects to exploit, privatize, and profit. but americans are not standing quietly by. attorneys with nrdc—along with other conservation groups, indigenous tribes, and scientists—have filed lawsuits against the government’s unprecedented plan to carve up the monuments, including bears ears and grand staircase-escalante, contending that president trump doesn’t have the authority to change the status of previously protected land. in addition, nrdc joined with the next 100 coalition—a group of civil rights, conservation, environmental justice, and community organizations, of which patton is a member—to highlight stories from some of the 2.7 million people who have called for the protection of lands now under siege. their impassioned arguments are a clear vision for a more inclusive approach to our country’s public lands, guided by respect for our vibrant cultures. “our public lands should reflect the diversity of our history and the diversity of our populace now,” says sharon buccino, director of nrdc’s land & wildlife program. “that diversity has increased—we weren’t nearly as diverse 100 years ago—but our public lands need to catch up.” here are some of the stories from our collaboration.
