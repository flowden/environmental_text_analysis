 a growing body of evidence shows that indigenous peoples’ rights to land are crucial to saving nature. deforestation, for example, is consistently lower in forests where indigenous have strong land rights. yet around the world, indigenous peoples’ territories are being chipped away by infrastructure development and mining projects — and depriving them of any of the benefits created by these projects. in response, conservation international’s center for communities and conservation is training a global network of indigenous negotiators. the goal: to empower indigenous peoples to assess and understand the impacts of largescale infrastructure and extractives projects on their lands, to access the emerging body of knowledge and strategic insights from effective negotiations across the global south, and to enhance their ability to effectively negotiate with external stakeholders in the public and private sectors around these projects. through this training, we can help level the playing field between indigenous communities and project developers that seek their consent — strengthening indigenous peoples’ contributions to conservation and climate change.
