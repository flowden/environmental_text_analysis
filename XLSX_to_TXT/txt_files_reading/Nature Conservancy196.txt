 “with such intense hydropower development on the yangtze, our nature reserve will be the only remaining habitat upstream of three gorges [dam] for hundreds of fish species. the nature conservancy is helping us find conservation solutions to the many threats facing our nature reserve, including a brilliant plan for upstream dams to mimic seasonal water flows that fish in our reserve need to survive.” zhao yimin is the office director for the yangtze river basin fisheries resource management commission. amid an unprecedented boom in hydropower development in the yangtze basin, the conservancy is working to implement a plan for the placement and operation of dams that will allow for the river’s most important ecological areas to remain as functional fish habitat while maximizing electricity production.
