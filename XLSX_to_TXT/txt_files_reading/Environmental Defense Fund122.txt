 when we launched edf climate corps in 2008, we knew it was a powerful idea: to pair graduate students with companies looking to reduce their environmental footprint. for companies, the experience can be an eye-opener. says a manager at bloomberg bna, “by day two on the job, our edf climate corps fellow saved us $100,000.” since the program’s inception, hundreds of edf climate corps fellows have identified projects that could reduce greenhouse gases equal to the annual emissions of 430,000 cars. this summer, 125 fellows helped clients ranging from a winery in california to a coca-cola bottling plant in shanghai. and clothing retailer gap inc. enlisted marine corps veteran and climate corps fellow lillian mirviss to help reach its ambitious target of slashing emissions 50% by 2020. mirviss identified three distribution centers as potential sites for solar power. her solution can be applied to gap inc.’s other distribution centers and provides a template for other companies to follow.
