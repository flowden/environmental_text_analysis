 denver’s cherokee power plant was once the area’s largest source of carbon pollution. today, the coal-fired plant is being replaced with wind energy and natural gas, and the city’s notorious “brown cloud” is largely history. for a decade, edf worked with cherokee’s owner, xcel energy, to anticipate pollution regulations, retire aging coal plants, and transition to modern clean energy resources. “our partnership led to breakthrough solutions for the environment,” says xcel ceo ben fowke. today, xcel is the nation’s leading utility for wind power. the company estimates its clean energy projects will ultimately save ratepayers $800 million in fuel costs. “our customers demand clean energy but want it at an affordable price,” says fowke. “with partners such as edf, we found a way to deliver it.”
