 the living planet report 2006*, published in october, is wwf’s biennial update on the health of the natural world and our impact on it. this latest edition confirms that we are using the planet’s resources faster than they can be renewed. humanity’s “ecological footprint” (fig.1) – our impact upon the planet – has more than tripled since 1961, and now exceeds the world’s ability to regenerate by about 25 per cent. the report also tells us that this relentless pressure is having predictable consequences on biodiversity: the living planet index (fig.2), which tracks the populations of 1,300 vertebrate species, shows a decline of more than 30 per cent since 1970. the message of the living planet report is clear and urgent: we must balance our consumption with the natural world’s capacity to regenerate and absorb our wastes. progress must be made on many fronts, from reversing our over- harvesting of fish to controlling our use of fresh water. the report also makes it clear that first and foremost we must change the way in which we generate and use energy. our reliance on fossil fuels, and the climate-changing emissions that result, now makes up 48 per cent – almost half – of our global footprint.
