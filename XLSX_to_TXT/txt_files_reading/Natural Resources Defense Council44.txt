 seven hundred staff members across eight offices. two million social media followers. three million members and online activists. as nrdc has grown in size and reach over the past 50 years, so has our network of partners and allies. together, we've increased both the visibility of the environmental challenges we face and the pressure to address them. whether by partnering with hollywood producers or news networks to weave climate issues into story lines, crafting ad campaigns to help inspire more sustainable consumer habits, or elevating perspectives of communities not often represented in the environmental movement, we continue to motivate new allies to join the fight. a healthier planet is possible when we rally for change together.
