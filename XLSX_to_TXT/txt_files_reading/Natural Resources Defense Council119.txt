 poachers killed more than 100.000 african elephants for their tusks between 2010 and 2012. in october 2015, nrdc helped secure a ban on ivory sales in california after an nrdc- commissioned investigation of the state's ivory market revealed that at least 80 percent of the ivory sold in los angeles and san francisco was likely linked to poaching. the california victory followed successful 2014 efforts to shut down the country's largest ivory markets in new york and new jersey. nrdc plans to move the campaign to other states and will continue to push for strong federal regulations.
