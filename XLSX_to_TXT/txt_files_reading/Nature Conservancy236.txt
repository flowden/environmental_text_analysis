 the conservancy purchased 2,325 acres of forestland that surround california’s independence lake from nv energy. the state of california, federal agencies, local nonprofi ts, private foundations and energy and water utilities aided our efforts to protect the lake, which safeguards an important source of drinking water for western nevada and a critical watershed for california’s water supply. the acquisition also supports the mainstay economy of the sierra nevada by providing a recreational outlet for sports enthusiasts, kayakers and other nature lovers and supports one of the last two wild lake populations of the lahontan cutthroat trout.
