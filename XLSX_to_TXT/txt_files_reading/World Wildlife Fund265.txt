 “further global warming of 1°c defines a critical threshold. beyond that we will likely see changes that make earth a different planet than the one we know,” says nasa’s goddard institute director and recipient of this year’s duke of edinburgh conservation medal*, dr james hansen. today, there are hardly any among the world’s political, industrial, and media leaders who doubt that climate change is an urgent problem and that it is largely a man-made phenomenon. with each new statistic the awareness of the looming crisis increases. but co2 emissions are still growing, and the world is warming faster than at any time in the last 12,000 years. the 1990s was the hottest decade in the past thousand years... we can curb climate change – if we act now. if we begin to make the switch to clean energy today we can keep global warming below the danger threshold. the window of opportunity is narrow, but experts tell us that if we manage to turn the trend of global co2 emissions in the next ten to fifteen years, we can succeed. and everyone can contribute – business people and investors, scientists and technicians, law makers and citizens.
