 “we know what it is to sacrifice our lands in wyoming for production, but we also know what it is to preserve them for values that are rooted in our culture. we want to balance these things. these agricultural places that are a part of our food production in the united states also serve this other function—they also have this ecosystem function and service for our country and for our communities. part of development by design is to identify areas in our state where we have high wildlife values and low energy potential. it’s a significant privilege to be able to manage and operate a large landscape like this. what i believe i’m doing in the long-term will be recognized as a significant effort for our heritage—i hope my sons get to benefit from that.” grounded in the conservancy’s scientific expertise, development by design provides a holistic view of how future development could affect our natural systems and offers solutions for ensuring their health over the long-term for the people and wildlife that depend on them. freddie botur manages his family’s cottonwood ranches, which secured mitigation- funded conservation easements based on a conservancy assessment of the property’s value as wildlife habitat. such protection offsets disturbance by energy development elsewhere, and encourages future development to be sited in areas with low wildlife values.
