 small steps for big conservation gains around 20 percent of the world’s coral is already gone; much of what remains could be wiped out by the end of this century. a conservation international study showed that this future can be prevented with relatively small steps such as creating marine protected areas or stronger fishing regulations. researchers found that when applied to coral reefs with low-to-medium human impacts, these two strategies create a “coral reef first aid kit” that can have massive benefits — giving reefs a fighting chance before it’s too late. deep-sea discoveries with the help of underwater robots and our partners at the noaa office of ocean exploration and research, scientists, including conservation international’s daniel wagner, discovered three new species of black coral in the north pacific, hundreds of meters below the surface. with lifespans ranging from centuries to millennia, black corals are some of the longest-living animals on the planet. they produce bioactive compounds that could be used to fight cancer and other diseases. more time is needed to study the deep sea. that’s why conservation international has called for a minimum 10-year moratorium on deep-sea mining — the biggest impending threat to deep-sea corals and many other vulnerable species — to better understand its risks and ensure we avoid endangering ecosystems that are still largely unknown. in 2020, we made new discoveries about coral reefs — epicenters of marine biodiversity, and linchpins of economies and food security around the world — which are under grave threat from pollution, overfishing and climate change.
