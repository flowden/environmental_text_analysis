 the conservancy helped launch the micronesia challenge, a historic commitment by five governments—palau, the federated states of micronesia, the marshall islands, guam, and the northern mariana islands—to effectively conserve at least 30 percent of marine resources and 20 percent of terrestrial resources by 2020. this innovative, locally led initiative spans 2.6 million square miles and supports the livelihoods of nearly 500,000 people. the conservancy is helping local partners to establish networks of protected areas, increase funding for conservation and address three pressing threats to the region’s biodiversity—climate change, invasive species and destructive fishing practices—by developing and testing strategies for use in other island nations around the world.
