 panama marks the southern end of the forest bridge of the americas, a finger of forest that runs the length of central america. although 80 percent of these forests have been cleared, this verdant ribbon of habitat packs more than seven percent of the earthâ€™s species into less than half a percent of its land mass. here, the conservancy is working with conservation partners to implement forestry certification programs, improve fire management, establish payment for ecosystem services, and empower local growers to develop sustainable land-use practices. over the next three years, these strategies will enable us to strengthen the management of 2.5 million acres of protected forests and certify an additional 100,000 acres under sustainable management.
