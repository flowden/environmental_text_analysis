 although overall support and revenue did not keep pace with the strong results posted in the prior year, financial results for fiscal year 2015 were solid. net assets grew by $146 million, and the nature conservancy experienced an operating surplus for the sixth consecutive year. long-term investment returns (+ 4.6 percent), though much better than benchmark (+ 1.4 percent), accounted for much of the decrease in overall revenue and support as financial markets generally underperformed compared with the previous year. the remainder of the decrease was primarily attributable to reduced funding available from public sources, particularly the u.s. government. private philanthropy, though slightly lower than the record levels of fiscal year 2014, did provide increased support of operations (versus capital project needs). programmatic efficiency (71.2 percent) remained relatively consistent with the prior fiscal year (70 percent). the financial results depicted here are derived from the conservancy’s audited june 30, 2015, consolidated financial statements, which contain an unqualified audit opinion. the conservancy’s complete, audited financial statements can be obtained online at nature.org/annualreport or by calling (800) 628-6860.
