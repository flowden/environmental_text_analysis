 “despite the significant achievements made by wwf in forest conservation over the past 40 years, the world’s forest landscapes continue to deteriorate. more than ever we need to reach out to new and existing partners to form a powerful, global alliance to reverse the trends that are bringing the world’s forests to the brink of ruin. in addition to our current partners, such as the world bank, iucn, and the forest stew- ardship council (fsc), we need to work with other ngos, labour unions, and consumer groups if we are to succeed in tackling the threats to forests posed by ineffective or inadequate government policies and the disastrous practices of some irresponsible members of the timber industry. wwf’s new targets for protecting, managing, certifying, and restoring forests will help to bring together the people and resources needed for effective long-term action. in particular, our work on forest landscape restoration gives us the opportunity to work with people and aid agencies in the fight against poverty.”
