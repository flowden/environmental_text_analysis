 a large share of afa's conservation and educational work depends on gifts, bequests, and donations from members, companies, and foundations. in 1984, we instituted an ongoing development program that includes two fundraising campaigns a year among ara members, an intensified effort to seek corporate and foundation grants for special projects and programs, and an ongoing effort to have gifts to afa included in wills and bequests. a member survey on important conservation issues and afa services in november and december of 1984 was associated with a fundraiser. 0ver 9,000 members responded, contributing many insights into their opinions of the organization and its programs, as well as over $72,000 to help support our 1984 efforts. our total development effort in 1984 raised nearly $200,000, including major gifts from the boise cascade foundation and champion international corporation.
