 nature bestows a summertime bounty of wild salmon in the crystalline rivers of alaska’s bristol bay. tnc stands committed to permanently protecting the bay’s lands and waters from plans to construct a mine in the headwaters. in bristol bay, the traditional way of life in alaska native villages has always relied on clean water and the yearly return of wild salmon. these fish number in the tens of millions, more than anywhere else on the planet, making bristol bay the last best hope for a culture and economy tied directly to the sustainable harvest of wild salmon. yet its remarkable rivers, lakes and habitat for bears and caribou still lack permanent safeguards against threats like the proposed pebble mine, meaning their future isn’t safe from harm. tnc’s science has long supported local indigenous organizations and the region’s sustainable com - mercial fishing industry, which, together in 2020, helped to temporarily stop the mine in a sustained campaign that continues today. through this broad coalition, tnc is building on this win and advocating for permanent legislative protection along with key investments in invigorating local economies and indigenous authority—all transformative steps in building a better future for people and nature tied to bristol bay.
