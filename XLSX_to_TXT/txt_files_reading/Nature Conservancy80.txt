 united states from prolonged droughts to flooded coastlines, no two u.s. states face exactly the same challenges from climate change. the nature conservancy’s 50-state climate strategy targets these differences by helping each state take its “best next step forward” toward large-scale, meaningful emissions reduction. the strategy found success this year in new hampshire, where the conservancy worked with the new hampshire sustainable energy association and partners to defeat a proposal that would have depleted the state’s renewable energy fund. the effort restored tens of millions of dollars to clean-energy investment. we also completed extensive public opinion research in many other states. the results were encouraging, including: new york displayed unprecedented support for increased renewable energy. west virginia showed interest in reshaping its economy to include clean energy. washington revealed a path to a statewide price on carbon. this valuable research will guide our climate policy in each state and help us reach key stakeholders.
