 as ocean conservancy turns 40 this year, we’re celebrating how far we’ve come by building our vision for the next 40 years. when we think about our ocean in 2050, ocean conservancy believes we will have found solutions for our water planet. all of us will be working together to ensure that the things you love about the ocean — wildlife like whales, dolphins and seabirds; the beaches you roam; the waves you surf and sail; and the seafood you enjoy — are protected. we imagine our nation’s fisheries thriving in a sustainable way, supporting well-paying jobs, providing for recreation and supplying americans with healthy seafood. we believe our goal of trash free seas will become a reality and that solutions-focused partnerships with industry, government, science and conservation leaders will create a culture in which trash is too valuable to toss. our future ocean includes a revitalized gulf of mexico region, restored in earnest after the bp deepwater horizon oil disaster, and an arctic that is thriving because we took the time to use sound science to make smart decisions about offshore drilling and other uses. we hope the next 40 years will bring political change as well; we foresee a future in which decision-makers are influenced by unwavering public support for ocean health and make science- based conservation a priority. we truly believe this vision for a healthy ocean in 2050 is achievable, but only with your continued support. looking back at our successes over the last 40 years, we recognize that we could not have done it without your generosity.
