 anadromous fish such as salmon and river herring migrate at different points in their life cycles between the ocean and freshwater flows. these fish travel hundreds or even thousands of miles every year, sending a pulse of life and nutrients through the nation’s major watersheds. examples of our 2020 grant-making include: a $294,000 grant to the idaho department of water resources will enable scientists and land managers to implement voluntary water transactions in the upper salmon river basin to ensure that chinook salmon and steelhead can access spawning grounds. leveraging a $101,000 grant from nfwf, trout unlimited will perform a critical analysis on water flow in alaska’s eklutna river to benefit not only migrating salmon, but also the people of the eklutna tribe. nfwf also awarded a number of grants to improve migration routes for alewives, american eels and atlantic salmon in maine and connecticut, including $172,000 to the connecticut fund for the environment and $143,000 to the aspetuck land trust.
