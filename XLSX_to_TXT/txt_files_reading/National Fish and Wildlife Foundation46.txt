 in 2005, the foundation continued its strong commitment to community-based conservation through the five-star restoration matching grants program. over $500,000 in matching grants were awarded for 53 community-led projects supporting wetland, riparian and coastal habitat restoration. grants averaging $10,000 fostered local natural resource stewardship through education, outreach and training. the stars in “five-star” are the partners and community participants that contribute to a project’s success. grant applicants, must demonstrate a diversity of partnerships of ideally five or more organizations that provide funding, technical assistance, manpower or other in-kind assistance. five-star itself is a collaborative effort of funding partners including the foundation, the national association of counties, the wildlife habitat council, u.s. environmental protection agency, and southern company.
