 with founding sponsorship from jpmorgan chase & co., the nature conservancy launched naturevest to the way we protect natural capital— the soil, clean air and water, and other valuable resources that nature provides. naturevest—a global conservation initiatives business unit—will do this by capitalizing on the growing impact investment sector and by fostering ways to advance investment in conservation. as part of that effort, naturevest will convene investors, develop and execute innovative fi nancial transactions and continue to build an investment pipeline across multiple sectors, including agriculture, fisheries and environmental markets. this endeavor builds on the conservancy’s impact capital strategy, launched in 2010 with inaugural support from the robertson foundation that continues, and a global deal pipeline built with subsequent support from the grantham foundation for the protection of the environment. nature.org/ar-naturevest
