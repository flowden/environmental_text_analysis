 while on a work trip to south africa, crawford allan, senior director of traffic/wwf, met an exhausted ranger patrol returning from a postmortem. the dead were four rhinos, poached for their horns in pilanesberg national park. “one of the rough-and-ready field guys was in tears over the slaughter,” says allan. “he cried out in frustration, ‘we are scared for our wildlife and our own safety. we need eyes in the sky to turn the tables on the poachers. we need all the technology and resources we can get—because this is a war, and the poachers are winning.’” wwf is responding. thanks to a $5 million global impact award from google, we are leveraging innovative technology to protect endangered species like elephants, rhinos and tigers in asia and africa. remote aerial survey systems, wildlife tracking tools and software-guided law enforcement capability will increase the detection and deterrence of poaching in vulnerable sites. “using technology to fight conservation crime is a game-changer for wildlife and wild places,” says allan. jacquelline fuller, director of google.org, agrees: “we’ve seen that wildlife poachers have an asymmetric advantage. wwf’s work to use technological breakthroughs will help to even the odds.”
