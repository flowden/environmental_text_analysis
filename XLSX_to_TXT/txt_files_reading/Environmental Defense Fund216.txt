 the number of shale gas wells in the united states has tripled since 2005, yet no one knows how much gas is leaking from wells, pipelines, storage and distribution facilities. determining leakage rates is critical because natural gas is mostly methane—a greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide. if too much gas is escaping, it would erase over the medium term the climate advantage natural gas has over other fossil fuels, which emit more carbon dioxide when combusted. in 2012, edf—in collaboration with 90 academic researchers and companies—launched a series of 16 research projects to measure methane emissions along the gas supply chain. researchers, led by the university of texas, published in 2013 the first data on methane emissions from hydraulically fractured shale gas wells. our goal is to ensure that industry minimizes methane leakage from the production, transportation and use of natural gas.
