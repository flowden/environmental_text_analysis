 the world’s largest coastal restoration project got a boost in june 2017, when louisiana approved a master plan to address its land-loss crisis. edf’s coalition mobilized the support of more than 200 businesses. the plan outlines how $50 billion is to be spent over 50 years on projects such as restoring barrier islands and rebuilding wetlands. already, 135 projects have been completed or are underway, including 50 miles of barrier islands. key to the plan is replenishing wetlands—which help protect new orleans from storms—by diverting sediment-rich mississippi river water. we’re sharing our coastal work with planners in other areas experiencing severe flooding. says steve cochran, director of edf’s mississippi river delta work: “coastal areas from miami to the mekong delta face similar challenges.”
