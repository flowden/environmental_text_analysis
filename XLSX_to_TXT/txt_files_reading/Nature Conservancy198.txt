 “our community organized to oppose proposals for commercial development of two properties, both with wetlands and one which sits within the mianus river critical environmental area. the proximity to headwaters of the mianus river has the community very concerned, particularly since our drinking water comes from wells. moreover, the mianus provides drinking water for more than 130,000 people. i never considered myself an environmentalist; to me the term connoted a granola-eating tree-hugger. but the issues are important to my family and my community, as we rely on the water source. this incident has completely changed my view about nature and conservation.” denise o’connor and her husband, steven, live within the mianus river watershed in westchester county, new york. the watershed also contains the mianus river gorge preserve, the conservancy’s first land protection effort. in 1955, the conservancy provided scientific expertise and innovative fi nance to enable a similar group of concerned citizens to acquire an initial 60 acres of old- growth hemlock forest. o’connor and her neighbors’ action is a reminder that citizen vigilance remains crucial to keeping nature healthy. o’connor’s evolution is also a reminder of the need to make conservation relevant and accessible to a much broader segment of society.
