 to help maintain the ecological and scenic integrity of this magnificent landscape, two private ranches totaling 1,200 acres were purchased on the north rim of the grand canyon. importantly, 850,000 acres of public land grazing allotments associated with the ranches will be managed to improve their value for wildlife. the two ranches lie in the heart of a vast system of conservation lands that encompass the kaibab plateau which is home to northern goshawk, apache trout, california condors, the endemic kaibab squirrel, as well as the largest stands of old growth ponderosa pines.
