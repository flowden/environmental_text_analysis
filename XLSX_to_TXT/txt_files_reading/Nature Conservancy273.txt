 people and nature around the world are already feeling the impacts of climate change. it threatens to erode coastal areas, strain clean water supplies, increase fires and collapse fisheries and farming operations. in nearly every community where the conservancy works, nature could become more resilient. by protecting and restoring ecosystems, the conservancy will help make plants, animals and people more resilient to the effects of climate change. for example, in kimbe bay, papua new guinea, where warming oceans threaten to kill coral reefs, the conservancy helped local communities design a network of marine protected areas that will be better able to bounce back from coral bleaching events, ensuring more sustainable fisheries for local people.
