 ice sheets around 12 feet thick have provided a protective natural barrier around some of our planet’s most pristine ocean ecosystems for millennia. but in recent years, the rapid disappearance of arctic sea ice due to global warming has cleared a path to the heart of some of these formerly remote areas—and oil and gas companies are clamoring to stake their claim. in response, nrdc has raced to court repeatedly to block proposed drilling in sensitive habitat for polar bears, whales, and other imperiled wildlife. we have waged a long-term campaign to block the shell oil company from drilling off the sensitive coastline of the arctic national wildlife refuge. and, in a major nrdc court victory in july 2010, a federal court halted oil and gas companies from moving ahead with drilling operations in millions of acres spanning alaska’s chukchi sea—one of our nation’s two “polar bear seas”—until more studies are completed on the impacts and risks of drilling. as the gulf oil disaster made clear, even the best existing technology cannot eliminate the staggering risks of offshore oil and gas drilling, and a similar-size spill in the arctic could have more profound consequences. canadian regulators recently warned that it would take at least three years to drill a relief well to cap an oil blowout in arctic waters. moreover, oil companies have no technology for cleaning up oil in broken sea ice—one of the main places where polar bears search for food. as we continue to fight in court on behalf of arctic wildlife, we are calling for a seven- year moratorium on drilling in arctic waters. internationally, we are working to promote protected areas and strong international rules on fishing, offshore oil development and other industrial development.
