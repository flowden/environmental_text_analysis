 the rob and melani walton foundation, the minderoo foundation and the global environment facility all joined as founding partners. with additional support from the tiffany & co. foundation and the gordon and betty moore foundation, the alliance made a big splash for the health of the world’s oceans, with several wins in its inaugural year: fiji invests in turtles: the waters surrounding the lau islands of fiji were the first blue nature alliance engagement, helping establish new protections covering 335,000 square kilometers (129,000 square miles) of ocean. this engagement builds upon the leadership of local communities to protect their coastal waters — and the species they support — including the village of mavana, which recently collaborated with conservation international to create a new marine protected area that prevents fishing and diving activities that could disturb endangered sea turtles’ habitat. tiny island makes big move: in the south atlantic, tristan da cunha — the world’s most remote inhabited archipelago — committed to protecting 90 percent of its territory’s waters, creating the largest marine protected area in the atlantic. through the alliance, conservation international provided critical funding and technical expertise that enabled this area to be protected at twice the size it would have been otherwise. in 2020, conservation international and the pew charitable trusts launched a global partnership to catalyze ocean conservation at an unprecedented scale.
