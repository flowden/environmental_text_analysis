 in the brazilian amazon, small-scale family farmers have driven approximately one-third of the total loss of rainforest by cutting down trees to create farm fields and cattle pastures for subsistence and income. but since 2012, tnc and the government of the state of pará have been providing technical assistance and training to encourage farmers to grow cacao trees—the source of chocolate—to reforest degraded lands and to provide a more sustainable source of income. last year, however, as harvest time neared, covid-19 hit brazil, making it too dangerous to conduct in-person training. the conservancy turned to a mobile-phone- based social-messaging app to deliver how-to videos to some 250 farmers in time to help with the harvest.
