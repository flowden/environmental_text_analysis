 the nature conservancy raised more than $1.055 billion in total revenue and support in 2019. this includes nearly $600 million in private support, similar to the three prior record-setting years for the organization excluding an extraordinary gift of $165 million in 2018. thanks to our strong financial position, we were able to deploy more than $752 million on conservation programs, land purchases and conservation easements in 2019. in addition to the success of our fundraising efforts, in 2019 we bolstered our balance sheet through the refinancing of $100 million in long-term debt using a creative funding structure that significantly lowered our capital costs. additionally, in 2019, the management of our long-term investment portfolio produced returns in excess of our bench- marks, which served to help support the long-term prospects of the business while also allowing for further spending in support of our mission. while programmatic efficiency dipped to 71.2% in 2019, down from 74.2% in 2018, this is in a range we find broadly acceptable, as we expect some fluctuations in this metric due to the cyclical nature of conservation-land-purchase activity. the financial results shown here are derived from tnc’s audited june 30, 2019 consolidated financial statements, which have received an unqualified opinion. the conservancy’s completed, audited financial statements can be obtained online at nature.org/annualreport or by calling (800) 628-6860.
