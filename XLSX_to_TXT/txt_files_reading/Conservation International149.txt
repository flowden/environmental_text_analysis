 a groundbreaking new effort could greatly expand our knowledge of where the wild things are. placed by researchers in natural areas around the world, “camera traps” snap millions of photos of wildlife each year. there’s more data than researchers can process or share — a lost opportunity for science. conservation international is working on a solution. in 2017, ci and its partners launched wildlife insights, the most comprehensive wildlife monitoring platform on the planet. cloud-based and open-source, the project will be operated in partnership with the smithsonian institution, wildlife conservation society, the north carolina museum of natural sciences and google. in 2018, this new platform will enable researchers — and anyone else — to view, share and analyze camera-trap photos.
