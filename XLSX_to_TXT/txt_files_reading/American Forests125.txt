 our policy center helps people understand and strengthen the links between healthy forests and vital communities. the forest policy center developed american forestsâ€™ national policy agenda for ecosystem restoration and maintenance which defines our mission. teaming with federal agencies and state foresters we provided information on these issues to congress through hearings testimony and congressional tours. working with community-based groups we supported federal programs such as urban and community forestry economic action programs and forest legacy and we supported their inclusion in the land and water conservation fund in support of the clinton administration's legacy initiative. support came from the ford foundation the surdna foundation the forest service and national urban and community forestry advisory council the bureau of land management and state forestry agencies.
