 the road to a global climate solution leads through china, the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter. with the united states exiting from the paris climate agreement, china has filled the void by demonstrating impressive leadership. twenty-five years ago, beijing called on edf to help guide the country’s first pilot projects using economic incentives to reduce pollution. later we provided technical assistance as china launched seven carbon trading pilot programs. their success inspired beijing to announce it would begin phasing in a national emissions trading system (ets). when the first phase of the ets is fully implemented, it is expected to cover roughly a third of the nation’s total emissions. we expect additional sectors to be covered as the ets expands in years to come. “edf is helping china develop infrastructure and policies needed to shift the economy toward a low-carbon future,” says our china managing director dr. zhang jianyu. the transition is being overseen by a new generation of environmental enforcement officers, more than 39,000 of them trained through a program edf established with leading universities. our goal: to see china’s carbon emissions peak by 2025, five years ahead of its paris commitment.
