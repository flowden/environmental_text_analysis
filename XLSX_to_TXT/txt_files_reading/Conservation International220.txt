 but these areas have been shut out of carbon markets, precluding incentives to protect them while depriving coastal communities of economic opportunities. conservation international achieved a breakthrough this year when its methodology for blue carbon crediting was approved. it is the first system of its kind to actually measure the amount of carbon stored in soils, where the majority of blue carbon lies. this approval is critical for harnessing the power of “blue carbon” ecosystems as a natural climate solution, ensuring that blue carbon credits are in compliance with some of the most rigorous and widely recognized standards on the market. it also creates a vital financial incentive to protect some of the most valuable carbon sinks on the planet. conservation international is now using the methodology to generate verified carbon credits in our project in cispatá, colombia, credits that will soon be available for sale on the voluntary market. hugging coastlines throughout the tropics, “blue carbon” ecosystems — mangroves, seagrasses and salt marshes — are climate superstars: in a single square mile, mangroves hold as much carbon as the annual emissions of 90,000 cars.
