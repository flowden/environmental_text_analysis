 with the election of donald trump, nrdc vowed to fight the administration’s every effort to undermine our environmental and hu­man health protections. we have stayed true to that promise from day one. while the trump administration spent its second year in office promoting polluters over public health, censoring science, and selling off our federal lands and waters to the highest bidders, we stepped up our litigation to protect the planet and its people and to hold corporate bad actors and negligent government agencies and officers to account. the result of our efforts in the courts, with the help of citizens who banded together and made their voices heard, has been a critical defense against these abuses of power.
