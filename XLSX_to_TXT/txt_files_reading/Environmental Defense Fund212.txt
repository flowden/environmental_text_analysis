 a world where power companies get paid to conserve and manage electricity, not just produce it. and where the electric grid balances demand with supply to use more renewable energy. we call this vision smart power—it’s the key to decarbonizing energy. electric utilities are at a crossroads. as they replace old, dirty power plants, they can either build more of the same or turn toward low-carbon energy. edf’s smart power program helps put the right incentives in place so technology can transform the energy sector as dramatically as it transformed communications. in nine states that make up nearly half the u.s. energy market, we’re working to strengthen clean energy requirements, remove obstacles to investment and realign business models. in texas, we’re part of pecan street, a neighborhood “lab” of residential homes that generate, store and sell power. in illinois, we helped persuade the commerce commission to order electric utilities to reduce carbon. and after the devastation of superstorm sandy, we worked with the governors of new york and new jersey to shape new ways to rebuild a more resilient energy infrastructure. we won’t stop until the united states has a modernized energy system. after all, our power grid hasn’t been updated since thomas edison invented it. it’s time for smart power. imagine a world where homes not only run on clean electricity but also generate, store and sell it.
