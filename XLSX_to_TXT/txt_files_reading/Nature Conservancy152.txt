 the first conservation easement outside the americas is protecting the world’s last forest of rare ka trees (terminalia carolinensis) in wetlands on the island of kosrae in the federated states of micronesia (right). local families who own the land and the conservancy’s micronesia program sought expertise from the conservancy’s california and north carolina chapters, opting to use funds from the transaction to create an endowment that will ensure the forest’s long-term conservation management. this pioneer project, involving many local and international partners, with funding from the david and lucile packard foundation and the u.s. forest service, should help spread the protection technique throughout the pacific and become another tool in furthering ridges-to-reefs conservation efforts in island nations around the world. nature.org/ar-kosrae
