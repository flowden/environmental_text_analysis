 climate change is no longer an abstract danger. it’s already affecting people’s lives and the places they live. rising seas, warmer temperatures and more intense storms threaten to shift habitats, damage economies and strain freshwater supplies. but nature is not just a victim of climate change—it also holds key solutions to the problem. if kept intact, the world’s forests will store massive amounts of carbon, and oyster reefs, corals and mangroves are nature’s own storm surge and erosion buffers. the conservancy is using the power of nature to help people and places adjust to predicted changes, protecting forests to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere and promoting national and international policies that would help enable these practices on a global scale. from on-the-ground projects in the forests of indonesia and along the shorelines of north carolina to the negotiating rooms where climate change policy decisions are made, the conservancy is finding solutions that will reduce the impact of climate change on people, nature and wildlife.
