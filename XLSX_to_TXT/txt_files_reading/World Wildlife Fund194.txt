 with funding from the jeremy and hannelore grantham environmental trust, wwf announced an $850,000 investment in ocean rainforest, a small for-profit company that operates a seaweed nursery, farms, and processing facility around the north atlantic’s faroe islands. seaweed is a fast-growing marine vegetable that is both a nutritious food source and—because it is highly efficient at absorbing co2—a valuable carbon sink. this venture marks wwf-us’s first impact investment, an effort designed to accelerate innovative business ideas that generate positive environmental outcomes as well as financial returns.
