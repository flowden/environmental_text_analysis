 in july, wwf published its living planet report*, a periodic update on the state of the world’s forests, freshwater wetlands, and seas – and the human pressures on them. the report shows that over 20 per cent more natural resources are being used each year than the earth can regenerate. based on likely scenarios of population growth, economic development and technological change, and current trends, the report projects that, by 2050, human beings will consume twice as many resources than the planet can replace every year. unless action is taken urgently by governments and with full backing from business and industry, wwf believes that, within 30 years, human welfare – as measured by average life expectancy, educational levels, and world economic product – could go into decline. “we do not know exactly what the result will be of running this mas- sive overdraft with the earth. what is clear though is that it would be better to control our own destiny, rather than leave it up to chance,” said jonathan loh, author of the report. dr claude martin, director general of wwf international, said: “the fact that we live on a bountiful planet, but not a limitless one, presents world leaders with a clear challenge. ensuring access to basic resources and improving the health and livelihoods of the world’s poorest people cannot be tackled separately from caring for the planet.” wwf believes that some fundamental changes must be made to bring our ecological overdraft back into balance: ● ● improve the way in which we use natural resources to generate economic wealth consume resources more efficiently while also redressing the disparity between high- and low-income countries, and ● protect, manage, and restore forests, wetlands, and marine environments better than we have succeeded in doing so far.
