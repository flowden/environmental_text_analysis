 america’s largest companies are making renewable energy part of business as usual, and the new corporate renewable buyers’ principles are a driving force behind that change. | forty-four corporate signatories, including walmart, developed the principles in an unprecedented collaboration with wwf and the world resources institute, in order to simplify the process of buying renewable energy and to help improve the future of us energy and electricity systems. | this shared vision could create exponential impact in making renewable energy more easily accessible at competitive rates for large and small businesses. the collaboration also demonstrates how a committed group of corporate customers can leverage their buying power to help usher in a clean energy future. | wwf is working with these businesses, and many others, to set strong goals that will result in billions of kilowatt hours of renewable energy demand, track that progress, and create solutions to help renewable energy buyers and utility providers meet the demand. | walmart has also actively worked with wwf in recent years to create new models for collaborative renewable energy delivery, and set ambitious targets across multiple conservation goals, including sustainable food, reduced emissions, and healthy forests. the most efficient big-box stores can supply up to 30% of their electricity on-site with rooftop solar energy systems. to meet 100% renewable energy goals, the rest must come from projects on the electricity grid. wwf director of us climate and energy policy marty spitzer talks solar panels, natural lighting, and renewable energy with katherine neebe, walmart’s director of sustainability and stakeholder engagement, at the company’s laurel, maryland, store.
