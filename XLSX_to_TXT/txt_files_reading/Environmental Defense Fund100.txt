 as hurricane harvey pummeled texas this summer, edf toxicologist elena craft saw a danger no one was talking about: toxic emissions from the many damaged petrochemical plants around houston. as storage tanks leaked, gas pipelines ruptured and fires broke out at industrial facilities, houston residents began complaining of nausea and dizziness. with nobody monitoring air quality, dr. craft hired a van with equipment for detecting toxic emissions. when the unit found a plume of benzene, a carcinogen, dr. craft (pictured) reported the finding to texas officials while alerting the media. after days of official inaction—and continued pressure from edf—epa inspected the facility. in part because of dr. craft’s work, texas governor greg abbott created a task force to investigate post-harvey toxic pollution. for years, dr. craft has led a coalition of community groups to reduce texas air pollution. “we often turn to elena for help on such issues,” says adrian shelley, director of texas public citizen. against the backdrop of a devastating hurricane season, proposed budget cuts at epa would cripple the agency’s ability to respond to disasters. edf is fighting the cuts and expanding pollution monitoring so states have the information they need to make informed decisions.
