 in a city consistently ranked among the world’s most livable, melburnians take pride in their green community full of birds, urban trees and parks. but melbourne is growing fast, and new neighborhoods haven’t always incorporated the parks and forests for which the city is known. the living melbourne plan—a “greenprint” for how and where nature can help make the city more sustainable, for both people and wildlife—represents a collaboration among more than 30 communities, agreeing on common values and goals. “melbourne needed a plan to... sustain [its] livability for people and nature,” says cathy oke, councillor for the city of melbourne. “we have to have a coordinated strategy to manage it across the entire metropolitan area.” the living melbourne plan uses spatial data technology to analyze existing forest resources, and also offers guidance to local leaders and community groups on how to work together to advocate for, and finance, more nature in the most beneficial places. the plan calls for efforts to protect and restore natural areas—on both public and private land—to increase forest cover in melbourne’s districts by up to 10%, and it will be guided by maps that show the most impactful locations for conservation. now, melbourne is a world leader in planning for urban nature to protect biodiversity as well as human health.
