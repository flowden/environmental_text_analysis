 in 2003, the conservancy, with support from wwf and conservation international, purchased 147,500 acres of biologically rich temperate rainforest on chile’s southern coast from a bankrupt forestry company. now the valdivian coastal reserve is a hub for the surrounding communities to rebuild a sustainable local economy. the conservancy is helping restore streamside native forests to improve water quality for a growing artisanal mussels and chilean abalone industry, and is supporting development of such micro-businesses as organic honey and ecotourism services, as well as efforts like marisa muñoz’s pesca sur sustainable seafood restaurant.
