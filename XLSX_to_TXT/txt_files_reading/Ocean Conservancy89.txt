 bringing the power of the ocean to the global fight against climate change ■ launched a campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from global shipping — focusing both on immediate reductions and pathways to full decarbonization. at a u.n. climate week event, we released a report that makes the case for widespread adoption of green electrofuels to transition to a zero-carbon future. ■ advanced ocean-climate priorities in the u.s. and globally. we launched an ocean-climate “playbook” for domestic policy; supported the ocean-based climate solutions act from the house natural resources committee; hosted high-level events and strategy sessions for countries to promote ocean solutions in the lead up to paris climate negotiations; advanced the work of our ambition coalition, the pacific rim ocean-climate action partnership; and created in-depth briefs on pressing issues, from climate-smart marine protected areas to deep-sea mining. ■ welcomed roger arliner young (ray) marine conservation diversity fellow, olivia lopez, who is using her passion for environmental justice to partner with underserved coastal populations especially vulnerable to climate change. she works alongside our other ray fellows, alliyah lusuegro (on fisheries) and rozette de castro (on ocean plastics).
