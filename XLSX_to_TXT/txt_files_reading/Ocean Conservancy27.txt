 commemorated the 5th anniversary of the national ocean policy and progress on smart ocean planning our ocean planning program protects marine ecosystems while balancing ocean uses like shipping, fishing, and recreation. five years ago, ocean planning in the u.s. was a long-sought dream; today we are months away from ocean plans for the northeast and mid-atlantic. we also celebrated construction of the country’s first offshore wind farm, made possible by rhode island’s smart ocean plan that we have showcased as a gold standard of ocean planning. thanks to the plan, this wind farm is a model of sustainable development, supported by fishermen and conservationists. we along with our industry and conservation partners are working to make smart ocean planning the new status quo for how our ocean is managed and preserved.
