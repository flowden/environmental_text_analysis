 activities like hiking, camping and fishing give us a deeper appreciation for the natural world and make us healthier and less stressed. getting people outside to enjoy our nationâ€™s forests is one of our priorities and many projects incorporate recreation as an objective. this year, access to recreation was key to our wildfire restoration project with mountain communities, a partner with whom american forests has planted more than 400,000 trees. through your support, this project, located in the san bernardino mountains, planted nearly 20,000 ponderosa and jeffrey pines to benefit wildlife, water and air, while also helping enhance a 150-acre educational facility and campground.
