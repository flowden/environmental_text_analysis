 michael bloomberg has never shied away from bold ideas that benefit the planet. as mayor of new york, he got to know edf staff as we worked together to clean the city’s air and reduce its carbon footprint. now, in his role as a prominent philanthropist, bloomberg has made a generous gift supporting edf’s work to help protect communities from the impacts of natural gas development by promoting stronger state and local environmental rules. “our approach at bloomberg philanthropies is not unlike a venture capital firm,” he says. “you see a team with the ideas you want to invest in, who have the best chance to succeed, and you commit.” bloomberg also chairs the global c40 cities climate leadership group. “cities around the world are making more progress in combating climate change than any other level of government,” he says. “edf doesn’t just talk about problems,” he notes. “they help design smart government policies, combine them with private sector know-how and create solutions. that’s why they are effective and why we are excited to partner with them.”
