 connect with nature launched as an annual campaign designed to get people involved in helping nature and help them rediscover its magic. more than 133 volunteer and community outreach events were held in 39 states during the initial april campaign. among them was “roots and routes to grow: a community tree planting day” in chicago park district’s burnham wildlife corridor. the event engaged more than 700 volunteers from the historic bronzeville and pilsen neighborhoods in an urban conservation and reforestation project right in their own backyard. parents around the world are concerned about their children’s diminishing involvement with nature; that’s the key take-away from a landmark survey released by the conservancy’s nature rocks program, supported by the disney worldwide conservation fund. this is the first global survey of parents in the united states, brazil, china, france and hong kong to capture how much time kids spend outside and parents’ perspectives on the importance of nature in their children’s lives. nature rocks seeks to inspire and empower families to connect with nature and build the next generation of conservation supporters. more than half of “nature rocks” participants say that their family time in nature has increased as a result. nature.org/naturerocks
