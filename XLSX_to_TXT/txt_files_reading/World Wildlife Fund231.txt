 on a sweeping tour of southern africa, wwf president and ceo carter roberts witnessed firsthand the deep devotion of neville isdell to this continent. roberts says this about the wwf board chairman: “africa runs deep in his veins.” as the two conservation leaders traveled across zambia, namibia and botswana to learn about an ambitious transboundary program to conserve africa’s elephants, they discussed plans to protect the unique landscapes and wildlife that surrounded isdell and his wife, pamela, during the 40-plus years they lived in zambia. more of those plans will be realized thanks to a generous $2 million gift from the isdells to wwf. part of the funding will support conservation and tourism initiatives in the 109 million-acre kavango zambezi transfrontier conservation area (kaza), home to nearly half of africa’s remaining elephants along with marvels such as carmine bee-eaters. zambia, where both isdells grew up and where they were married, will see the greatest impact of the gift, which will empower communities to engage in wildlife-based activities that improve local economies. “this gift reflects our determination to help people and wildlife live in harmony for the benefit of all of zambia,” says isdell.
