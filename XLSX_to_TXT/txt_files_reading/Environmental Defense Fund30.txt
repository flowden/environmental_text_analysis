 when hurricane maria took down puerto rico’s electric grid in 2017, some residents endured nearly a year without power. on culebra, an island off puerto rico’s northeast coast where dulce del rio-pineda lives, people relied on noisy, dirty diesel generators for 18 months, but fuel was scarce. del rio-pineda is a co-founder of mujeres de islas, a women’s collective that’s rebuilding culebra’s self-reliance. as climate change threatens puerto rico with increasingly damaging storms, the group is turning to solar power, starting with a community kitchen that doubles as a culinary school. such community-led efforts are key to edf’s initiative to build a more resilient power system in puerto rico. we’re advocating legal reforms and developing innovative financing to support low-carbon microgrids — small electric networks that can run independently of the main grid — to give communities like culebra access to clean, affordable and reliable power, even after storms. “it’s not just throwing panels on houses,” says del rio-pineda. “edf knows the policies and economics that can help communities become sustainable.”
