 a number of factors continue to drive explosive growth in the demand for projects that strengthen resilience, including coastal population growth, increasing risks from hurricanes, and widespread declines in coastal wildlife populations. in its first three years, the national coastal resilience fund received 336 grant applications, of which 124 earned grant awards. we employ scientific approaches to determine which projects would maximize benefits to wildlife and human communities. nfwf recently worked with noaa, the university of north carolina asheville and other partners to develop an assessment tool to identify coastal locations where nature-based infrastructure would benefit wildlife while also protecting vital community assets such as storm evacuation routes and hospitals.
