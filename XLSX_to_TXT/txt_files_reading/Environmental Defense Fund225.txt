 goal: reduce pollution from transportation. why: children who live near high-traffic roads face a higher risk of asthma, cancer and heart disease. meanwhile, pollution from ships and trucks disproportionately affects those who live near u.s. ports. our objectives by 2015: 1/ national limits are secured on dangerous smog- and soot-forming pollutants from new cars. 2 / substantial reductions of diesel emissions from marine sources and portrelated transportation are achieved at all continental u.s. ports.
