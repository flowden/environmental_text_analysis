 the success of ci’s events is made possible only by the extraordinary group of supporters and volunteers who give us their time, their energy and their ideas. we’re grateful for their commitments— and for their efforts, which enabled spectacular celebrations of ci’s 25th anniversary, helped us raise millions to secure human well-being around the world and gave us a platform to honor some of ci’s most steadfast supporters: betty moore, gordon moore and henry arnhold.
