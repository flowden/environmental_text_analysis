 nrdc is helping to secure safe and sufficient water for people and our planet’s natural ecosystems by promoting water efficiency strategies to help decrease the amount of water wasted; protecting our water from pollution by defending the clean water act and advocating for solutions like green infrastructure; helping prepare cities, counties, and states for water-related challenges they will face as a result of climate change; and ensuring that waterways have enough water to support vibrant aquatic ecosystems. in order to minimize our own impact, nrdc measures and seeks to reduce our water use in offices. initiatives include using ultralow-flow fixtures and reusing gray water in our santa monica office, where water is scarcer. en8 total water withdrawal by source. in fy2014, nrdc started to measure water use directly with water meters. en10 percentage and total volume of water recycled and reused. the robert redford building (santa monica office) uses a water recycling system that captures gray water collected from our showers and sinks, and rainwater. this combination of water is run through our equaris infinity disinfection and filtration network, then used for irrigation and flushing toilets. the system processes around 10 gallons of gray water a day, and also captures and uses rainwater. it incorporates two custom-built, 40-foot long nrdc sustainability as an ethical imperative 19 cisterns hidden beneath large planters that store a total of roughly 3,000 gallons of rainwater. the building’s porous paving system and landscaping planters allow water to be filtered, then percolate into the ground to recharge the groundwater, instead of contributing to urban runoff. we have upgraded our office bathrooms in multiple offices, using all recyclable materials and ultralow-flow toilets and sinks, reducing water use. in 2014, we began real- time water usage monitoring in our offices in new york, washington d.c., chicago, and santa monica.
