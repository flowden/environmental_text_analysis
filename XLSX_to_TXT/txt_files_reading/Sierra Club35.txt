 state implementation plans (sips) for the president’s clean power plan must contribute to equity and justice. in 2015, we funded the “climate works for all” process led by align (the alliance for a greater new york, an affiliate of the bluegreen alliance, partnership for working families, and jobs with justice). this important process leverages new york city mayor deblasio’s announcement of an 80% carbon reduction goal by 2050 as a platform to educate and organize around quality careers for members of economically distressed communities. this same kind of community partnership-building with faith-based groups over the past decade has helped grow awareness and trust between non- traditional climate allies, further spurred by pope francis’ teaching on climate culpability. as nature’s healing powers become more easily accessible to all, disadvantaged youth, veterans, and others who need it most can become the next generation of environmentalists.
