 a native of chile, nicolas gordon became concerned about climate change while working as a trekking guide in patagonia and observing how glaciers shrank “on a weekly basis.” as a 2013 edf climate corps fellow, gordon worked at aig in new york city, where his recommendations, which included adding sun window films to reduce the air-conditioning load, could save $500,000 in operating costs annually. “for me, sustainability is more than a field, it’s how you approach everything,” says gordon.
