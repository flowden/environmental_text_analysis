 ocean conservancy’s trash free seas® program assumed leadership of the global ghost gear initiative (gggi) this year. the international alliance addresses one of the deadliest forms of marine debris: lost and abandoned fishing gear, known as ghost gear. with projects in 15 countries, the focus is on recovering ghost gear, such as fishing traps and nets, from the ocean while implementing practices and policies to prevent fishing gear from being lost in the first place. we also combatted plastics in the ocean by launching a new finance partnership with circulate capital and the u.s. agency for international development (usaid) to channel resources into investments aimed at improving waste management. specifically, usaid will guarantee up to $35 million of loans made by circulate capital to boost investment in recycling infrastructure in south and southeast asia. and we announced that our international coastal cleanup, the world’s largest effort to remove marine debris from beaches and waterways around the world, surpassed one million volunteers for the first time in its history.
