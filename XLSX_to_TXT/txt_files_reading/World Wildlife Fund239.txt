 negotiating in a spirit of shared commitment to borneo’s forests, wwf joined with the nature conservancy and the governments of indonesia and the united states to craft a debt-for-nature swap that will result in $28.5 million for conservation. the investment will be used to establish working models for forest conservation and greenhouse gas reductions in three districts within kalimantan, indonesia. borneo is the third-largest island in the world, and its forests, which are being destroyed at the rate of nearly 2.1 million acres a year, shelter orangutans, gibbons, some of the world’s rarest elephants, and well over 10,000 species of plants. almost 8 million people live in east and west kalimantan, and forest loss is impacting their main source of food, water, medicine and building materials. deforestation is also contributing to climate change. negotiated by wwf’s conservation finance team, the deal will help local communities protect their forests, securing a home for wildlife as well as long-term economic growth.
