 "as one strategy among many to protect ocean and coastal resources, marine protected areas (mpas) have emerged as an effective conservation approach that also preserves livelihoods. as it does on land, the nature conservancy has helped create numerous protected areas in the sea, including one of the worldâ€™s largest in the coral triangle in the west pacific. with assistance from the conservancy and world wildlife fund, and two local ngos, bestari and kahati, the government of berau, indonesia, created a 1.2-million-hectare mpa containing the second highest level of coral biodiversity in the world (the first is in the raja ampat islands in eastern indonesia). local involvement in the creation of this mpa has been unprecedented: the berau district" government is the first local government ever to establish its own mpa. mpas carry varying degrees of protection: some are sanctuaries where extractive activities are off limits, while others sustain scientific research and recreational uses, like tourism and the sustainable use of marine resources. science, policy and partnerships are prov- ing to be key elements to the effective management of mpas. in parts of the coral triangle, for example, the fishermen themselves monitor and enforce the guide- lines and restrictions, recognizing the importance of sustaining their marine resources over the long term.
