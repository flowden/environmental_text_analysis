 mauricio galvez, head of research at ifop, chile’s fisheries development institute, once helped create the largest notake marine protected area in the americas, the nazca- desventuradas marine park. lately, he has found himself in international deliberations, as more fish cross in and out of chile’s national waters because of climate change. working with edf, galvez and his counterparts in the humboldt current region are sharing baseline scientific data on marine resources, while developing an early warning system to predict climate impacts on fisheries. high-resolution modeling provided by noaa could help these nations plan for the future. “our countries have a history of working together on anchovy,” says galvez. “but with climate change, we now need to think at ecosystems scale.” “edf has been an honest broker in the process,” adds renato guevara, the scientific director for imarpe, peru’s national ocean research institute. “they’re helping us navigate the science in a rapidly changing environment.” the kind of collaboration that edf is fostering in the region will be needed around the globe.
