 in 2016, we expanded the clean energy movement and kept dirty fuels in the ground by investing in strategic policy and legal work and by tapping into local, grassroots activism. arctic youth ambassador esau sinnok is an inupiaq eskimo whose village must relocate due to severe climate change disruption. esau attended the united nations cop21 in paris as an international delegate representing the sierra club and his indigenous community, demanding global climate action from world leaders. just over a decade ago, sierra club’s nascent beyond coal campaign challenged three proposed coal plants in iowa, a state that generated 75% of its energy from coal. after years of partnering with local groups to close coal plants and advance clean energy, the sierra club has helped charter a renewable energy future for the state that is growing the economy and jobs without threatening the health of communities. in 2016, iowa made clean energy history when it approved the nation’s largest-ever wind project. on a municipal level, sierra club’s ready for 100 campaign is inspiring cities across the country to generate 100% of the energy they use from clean, renewable sources within the next two decades. twenty-one cities—including boulder, salt lake city, and st. petersburg—made the 100% clean energy commitment, and we’ll continue to accelerate change locally. none of this progress would be possible without community leaders who hold decision makers accountable for providing clean air and water, clean energy, and equitable climate solutions for all.
