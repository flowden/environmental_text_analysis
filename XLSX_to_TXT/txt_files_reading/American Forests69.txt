 approximately 87% of the payette national forest is forested with a continuous landscape of low- to mid-elevation forest, an ideal home for about 300 wildlife species, including elk, deer, moose, black bear, mountain lion, wolverines, and fishers. the cflr project is working to increase economic activity through biomass utilization, forestry, and natural resource jobs. approximately 50,000 green tons of biomass chips and 50,000 ccf of sawtimber will be produced annually across the 190,000 acre project area. forest restoration is complicated and doing it through collaboration requires extensive information sharing. managing information is how dennis murphy provides a critical service to the weiser-little salmon collaborative forest landscape restoration project on the payette national forest in central idaho. through his business spatial interest out of mccall, idaho, dennis serves as the scribe, web master, institutional memory, librarian for internal communications and external research, meeting coordinator and geographic information systems wonk for the payette forest coalition (pfc.) the three-year-old pfc provides recommendations for consideration to the payette national forest, in the 900,000 acre cflr landscape. “my work contributes to the way the collaborative functions to make good decisions, and forest management is tough enough even in one organization,” he explained. “to combine more than 20 organizations, with 20 to 25 citizens attending each pfc meeting, requires data management.” besides pfc, dennis provides technology and management to a number of other idaho collaborative groups in addition to the pfc. “cflr raises visibility of forest restoration and focuses attention on a few forests to provide a window of opportunity to show restoration work can be done in a collaborative way,” he said. “people can work together in order to find common goals and objectives to have ecological benefit and benefit the community.”
