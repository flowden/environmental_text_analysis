 measurable outcomes for fish take many forms. throughout 2007, nfwf, its partners, and grantees emphasized high impact results that include: supporting the development of regional fish habitat partnerships around flagship fish species and habitats and increasing the capacity of these groups to address priority conservation needs; identifying key metrics for successful conservation plans; implementing habitat protection, enhancement, and restoration projects that demonstrate the highest impact in restoring targeted fish populations in a watershed context; tracking changes in populations of flagship species where onthe- ground conservation actions are implemented; measuring miles of spawning and rearing habitat protected, restored, or opened; stimulating the development of effective plans for species for which no strategy is currently available, and revising plans that need improvement or updating; evaluating which species conservation plans workâ€”and why; expanding environmental water transaction programs and water conservation efforts to increase streamflows during critical migration periods for fish passage and spawning; removing small dams, culverts, and other physical barriers to maximize access to miles of upstream spawning and rearing habitat; improving populations of imperiled fish species by managing or removing species that out-compete them in their native habitats; and promoting stewardship activities involving angler groups and other community-based organizations
