 edf has been fighting to protect the public from lead since the 1980s, when we were instrumental in getting lead removed from gasoline. since then, blood levels of lead for americans have declined more than 90%. but many remain at risk, especially children in low-income communities. scientists say that no amount of lead exposure is safe. when news of the flint, michigan, water crisis broke in 2015, at issue were the pipes that connect water mains to individual homes. these service lines were once commonly made of lead, creating a health hazard, and it’s a problem not limited to flint. across the united states, more than 6 million homes get their water from lead service lines. the most effective and lasting solution is to replace all those pipes. to speed that process, edf is helping communities assemble an inventory of lead service lines, tracking which communities and states are taking action and advancing scientific and legal research. historically, public health officials and water utilities have not communicated well, so edf is helping convene meetings between them. we’re also supporting cities and states through the lead service line replacement collaborative — a partnership of 27 national organizations co-founded by edf that works to accelerate replacement of lead pipes across the country. we’ve seen tremendous progress, with more than 180 communities and 16 states working to replace their lead service lines.
