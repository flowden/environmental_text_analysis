 ending tropical forest loss and allowing degraded forests to regenerate could reduce overall global greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25 percent. “introducing economic incentives to make forests more valuable alive than dead is one of the best paths to lower global emissions,” says dr. steve schwartzman, edf senior director for tropical forest policy. walmart, a longtime edf partner, announced it will urge suppliers to support forest-friendly projects in parts of brazil, indonesia and malaysia as part of project gigaton, its program to cut climate pollution from its supply chain. unilever, one of walmart’s biggest suppliers, has pledged to help the malaysian state of sabah achieve 100 percent sustainable palm oil production. “these corporate efforts will spur more industry action and encourage deforestation-free jurisdictions across the globe,” says edf supply chain expert katie anderson. despite troubling indications that brazil’s central government could weaken some forest protections, the state of mato grosso—the country’s biggest agricultural producer—has, with edf’s help, committed to ending illegal deforestation by 2020.
