 “for future generations” has long been the phrase used by conservationists to explain their primary motivation for protecting the natural world. and it’s true that most people have an innate desire to leave the world a better place for their children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews or those they teach and nurture. but motivation likely came from the past as well. most of us can trace our appreciation of the natural world to an inspiring elder, educator, or in today’s age, media personality. how many conservation scientists were inspired to follow that path by watching jacques cousteau or wild kingdom on television as children? we share generational relationships with many of the creatures we seek to protect through conservation. in east africa, orphaned elephants raised by humans and released back into the wild are known to return years later to introduce their babies to the people who rescued them a generation earlier. there, too, a half-century of primate research has produced family-tree charts for chimpanzees that are as complicated and revealing as our own. the eight stories that follow explore generational connections within the nature conservancy’s work—across continents and cultures, where traditions are honored and others are challenged, where tributes are paid to those who inspired and where investments are made in those who hold the future in their hands.
