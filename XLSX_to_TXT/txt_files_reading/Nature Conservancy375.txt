 the southwest corner of australia is a global haven for plant diversity. although sparsely populated, nearly two-thirds of the vegetation has been cleared for agriculture, which much of the land can no longer sup- port. gondwana link is a visionary effort by six australian organizations and the nature conservancy to restore and reconnect a 620-mile swath of native bushland that includes the tall wet forests flanking the indian ocean and a relatively undisturbed—yet currently unprotected—interior woodland the size of maine. farmland and privately owned lands at risk make up only a small percentage of the total link, and already some 20,000 acres have been protected, and 3,700 acres of barren farmland restored with plants found only in that part of the world.
