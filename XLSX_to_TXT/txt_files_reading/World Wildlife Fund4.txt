 wwf’s long-term conservation goals are supported by its international campaigns to spotlight crucial environmental issues and influence national and international policy decisions. currently there are four such campaigns: ● forests for life – to protect the world’s forests; ● living waters – to ensure adequate fresh water for people and nature; ● endangered seas – to protect marine areas and stop the depletion of fisheries; ● climate change – to lobby for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. these campaigns aim to reach concrete con- servation targets and encourage individuals, corpora- tions, and governments to take action, including making “gifts to the earth” – commitments to pre- serve the most significant parts of our planet. by mid-2000,wwf had registered 56 gifts to the earth – ranging from ecuador’s conservation law to protect wildlife in the galapagos islands to the creation of new national parks and protected areas in canada,gabon, mongolia,new zealand,russia,and south africa.
