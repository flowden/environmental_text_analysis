 at the same time nrdc is building a clean energy economy in america, we are also helping to push it forward in china and india. nrdc has been working in china for more than 15 years, and the influential experts in our 30-person beijing office have successfully advocated for cutting- edge national and provincial energy policies. in 2009 nrdc launched a u.s.-india initiative on climate change and energy, and our experts are poised to become equally well regarded in india. our key international strategy is to take successful models and help adapt them to local circumstances. a program nrdc helped design in california to reduce electricity demand has now been adopted by china nationwide; a program we launched to accelerate building efficiency in california and new york was expanded to hyderabad, india. we also develop programs on the ground. in the chinese province of jiangsu, nrdc helped design energy efficiency measures that are saving 3.5 million mwh each year and are now being scaled up nationwide. but our collaboration is a two-way street. as china and india invest heavily in clean energy, our experts bring those stories back to washington lawmakers, reminding them why america needs to stake its place in the global clean energy market. our international experts also continue to engage in international climate negotiations. nrdc played a key role in advocating for more robust reporting and transparency on emissions and mitigation actions by china, india, and other developing countries, removing a key stumbling block to the international climate negotiations.
