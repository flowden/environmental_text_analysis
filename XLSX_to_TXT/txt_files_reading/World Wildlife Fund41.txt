 in the last six years, climate change has moved from the back page to the front. it has gone from an issue that governments could ignore, to one that affects foreign policy and national elections. it is fair to say that non-governmental organizations generally, and wwf specifically, can claim a good deal of the responsibility for lifting climate change to the top of the political agenda. wwf has been present and active in the key moments of the climate debate – highlighting the scientific basis for action, convincing companies to move forward, engaging the public, and pressuring governments to adopt a serious approach to climate change. the acceptance by 178 countries of the climate treaty in july 2001 is but the start of a whole new phase of work. huge challenges lie ahead, not least ratification of the treaty and positive steps to turn promises into reality. wwf is well prepared to face those challenges head on by using the lessons it has learned over the last six years to move the world to the next stage – a world where carbon has a value, businesses have carbon management plans, and governments are held truly accountable for their actions on climate change. wwf is well placed and ready to go.”
