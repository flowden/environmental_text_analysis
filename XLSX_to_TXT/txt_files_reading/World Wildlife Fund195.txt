 wwf analyzed the plastic use of five companies, including mcdonald’s corporation and the coca-cola company, and identified just how much plastic companies were using and where it went after it was disposed of. thanks to these companies’ transparent disclosure of their plastic footprints, wwf has identified pain points in the plastic life cycle that serve as a starting point for recognizing global plastic trends across industries. onboarding 100 more companies to the project could keep more than 50 million metric tons of plastic out of nature over time.
