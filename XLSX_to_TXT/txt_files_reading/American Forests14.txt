 faced with drought, wildfires, pests and disease, our native forest landscapes are in peril as a result of climate change. meeting these challenges requires smart thinking and galvanizing action to plant climate-adapted trees, develop policy initiatives to emphasize forest-climate solutions and create collaborative plans that benefit all stakeholders. in 2018, we significantly intensified our work in the lower rio grande valley, a unique biodiversity hotspot, where we have been working and making an impact for more than 20 years. this year, we planted 100,000 trees to continue restoring thornscrub and deepened our engagement with new partnerships supported by new funding. along with adapting critical thornscrub forest to future climate conditions, our ongoing efforts will continue to provide habitat for over 500 species of songbirds and 300 species of butterfly in this area. people and economic impact are at the center of our white oak restoration efforts in the ozarks and appalachians. the foundation of a thriving forest products market, including the barrel-making process essential for wine and whiskey production, white oak is critical to many jobs and communities but is currently at a conservation crossroads. american forests is working with on-the-ground partners to create the conditions to sustainably manage the species for future generations. there are few areas of the country where forests are suffering more than the sierra nevada and southern california ranges. california has lost 129 million trees since 2010, many in the sierra nevada, where american forests is using science-based planning to expand future forests that can withstand the current climate hardships and continue to provide their essential water and wildlife benefits.
