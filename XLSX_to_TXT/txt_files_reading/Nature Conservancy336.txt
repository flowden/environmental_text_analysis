 the circular path from global to local cai zhao, a resident of a tiny village inside the songshan national nature reserve in china, probably doesn’t think what happens in a conference room could affect his daily life. but it’s the international and national commitments made to conservation in just such conference rooms that led to the creation of songshan and the subsequent economic benefits for zhao and the community, such as being paid to assist in fire prevention patrolling and to not log in the area. international policy treaties such as the convention on biological diversity are venues through which national leaders set conservation goals for their countries. the conservancy not only collaborates with government leaders to help a country determine what those goals should be, it works with local nongovernmental organizations and other partners to make those goals a reality. on the other end, bringing local community members to an international forum gives the people who are directly affected by these policy decisions a stronger voice in shaping them. local and indigenous community members bring with them thousands of years of experience with conserving their natural resources.
