 conservation means accounting for the many uses of a given area of land or sea. yet laws governing the use of nature vary widely from one border to the next — and water, weather and wildlife pay no heed to borders. so how do we protect nature — and people’s access to it — in the face of such complexity? around the world, conservation international is cracking the code. we’re connecting science, finance, policy and people to create selfsustaining, scalable conservation models that can be adapted from one country to the next by focusing on large ecological systems —what we call landscapes or seascapes. first step: get the widest view possible — in this case, from 400 miles above the landscape. last year, we demonstrated how to make this approach work in west africa. conservation international joined forces with nasa, the u.s. space agency, using nasa’s unparalleled satellite data to begin quantifying the sources and flows of the very benefits that nature provides to people in liberia. this way, we will be able to calculate the value of these ecosystem services, enabling smarter policy decisions that benefit people and nature.
