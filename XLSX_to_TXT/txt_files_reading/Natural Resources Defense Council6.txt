 during a year when staying safe meant staying home, nrdc's calls for equal access to the most basic necessities-clean running water, unpolluted air, secure housing, and access to healthy food-became even more urgent. after all, guaranteeing these human rights is paramount to society's ability to weather crises like the covid-19 pandemic. investing in them will be essential to moving forward as a more just and equitable society. neglecting them will only set us back. in alliance with frontline communities- predominantly black, indigenous, and people of color-who face the greatest impacts from inaction on climate change and environmental injustice, we at nrdc have recommitted ourselves to those fights and to the pursuit of a smarter, more sustainable, more just tomorrow.
