 this project permanently conserved 312,000 acres of forestland, securing the second largest forestland conservation easement in u.s. history. these forestlands are strategically positioned between protected lands in canada and state, federal and native american lands in maine, connecting more than one million acres of essentially uninterrupted habitat. the lands benefit hundreds of species from birds to bear and moose. they will also remain open for public access and continue to contribute to the regionâ€™s economy through sustainable forestry operations.
