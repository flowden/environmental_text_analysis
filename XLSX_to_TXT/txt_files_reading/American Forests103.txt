 this year, american forests launched a new initiative to fundamentally change the way we think about forests and the environment in general. we call it a new framework. more than 130 years ago the nation’s forests had a critical need for scientific forest management; american forests helped with that and it succeeded. today we need to rebuild the vital functions of the natural system that provides the foundation for forests, wildlife, and humans. you can’t save the system by saving just pieces; they are not isolated islands but integral parts of the natural system as a whole. our new framework explores how the natural and the human network—the communities and infrastructure people build — function and how to most effectively manage their inter- action. understanding this will allow us to create a workable policy framework.
