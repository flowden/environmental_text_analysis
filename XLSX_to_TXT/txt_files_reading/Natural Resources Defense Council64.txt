 just as bird lovers all around the world were celebrating the 100th anniversary of the migratory bird treaty act of 1918, this critical law—and all the birds it protects— came under attack by the trump administration. the migratory bird treaty act (mbta) makes it illegal to kill or injure any of the more than 1,000 bird spe­cies listed under the act. one of the country’s oldest wildlife protection laws, it has saved millions of birds every year and is credited with rescuing the snowy egret, wood duck, and sandhill crane from extinction. everyday threats like power lines, communications towers, and oil waste pits can kill or harm tens of millions of birds every year. and then there are larger incidents. for example, the 2010 bp deepwater horizon oil disaster killed a million birds—and bp had to pay $100 million in criminal fines for violating the mbta. but the trump administration has significantly weakened the law to allow companies to get away with preventable bird deaths—no matter how egregious the act. under the new interpretation by the u.s. department of the interior, indus­tries will no longer be held accountable. birds don’t recognize borders, and so they desperately need federal protections. that’s why nrdc joined a coalition of national environmental groups last spring to file a lawsuit challenging the trump administration’s move to eliminate longstanding protections for waterfowl, raptors, and song­ birds under the mbta. attorneys general from eight states— new york, california, illinois, maryland, massachusetts, new jersey, new mexico, and oregon—filed a second suit last fall pushing back against the dismantling of the law, adding more muscle in the fight to keep this vital bird protection intact.
