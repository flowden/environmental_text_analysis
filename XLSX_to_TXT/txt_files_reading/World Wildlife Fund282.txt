 celebratingthe amazon at tonight’s wwf annual dinner, we join the brazilian environment minister, the colombian and brazilian ambassadors, and other key partners to celebrate the success of our flagship amazon conservation initiative — arpa, the amazon region protected areas program. through arpa, more than 79 million forest acres have been protected. and while establishing protected areas is a key tenet of sound conservation, protected areas alone won’t get the job done — especially in places like the amazon, where market forces such as agriculture and development are threatening landscapes, species and livelihoods. wwf’s markets program is addressing the impacts of these global forces by cultivating relationships with key companies whose production practices can tip global commodities markets toward sustainability. together we aim to push the envelope of best practices and establish sustainability as a pre-competitive issue.
