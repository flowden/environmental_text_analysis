 meaningful and measurable outcomes, evaluation, and accountability mark the national fish and wildlife foundation’s (nfwf) new direction. what can a wildlife conservation foundation learn from the approach that a hedge fund manager uses to choose investments? might the painstaking analysis and accountability demanded by successful investors result in better returns for fish and wildlife? that’s the bet that nfwf is making with its new keystones. the national fish and wildlife foundation has an impressive conservation track record. since our inception in 1984, more than 10,000 grants have been funded and nearly $600 million in federal, corporate, and other funds have been awarded to some 3,500 organizations and agencies. when matching contributions from our partners are added in, nearly $1.4 billion has been invested in on-the-ground projects in all 50 states and more than 50 countries around the world. over the years, we’ve helped launch or contribute to some of the most important conservation initiatives in history: the north american waterfowl management plan, the partners in flight migratory bird program, pacific salmon restoration, endangered species recovery, chesapeake bay restoration, and many more. reflecting on these accomplishments and the scope of our giving over nearly 25 years, we constantly ask ourselves: how can we increase the frequency of our successes and the impact of our grantmaking? we believe the answer to this question lies in a more analytical approach to conservation investing, embedded in an unwavering focus on measurable outcomes and a passion for accountability. we may never have the precise metrics found on wall street, but we are convinced that this approach will lead us to more conservation successes.
