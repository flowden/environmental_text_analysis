 two new municipal protected areas and the first indigenous municipal protected area in south america were created to preserve more than 600,000 acres of bolivian cloud forests. prometa, a bolivian conservation organization, helped establish the parks by applying tools they acquired while being supported by parks in peril, a joint 17-year partnership between the conservancy and the u.s. agency for international development. besides shifting the paradigm for advancing international conservation, parks in peril secured the lasting protection of 45 parks and reserves covering 44.8 million acres in 18 countries across latin america and the caribbean.
