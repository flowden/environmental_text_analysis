 climate summit. much of the campaign’s work is focused on lobbying governments to improve the kyoto protocol, an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.the world climate summit (officially the sixth conference of parties to the un framework convention on climate change) in the hague in november 2000 was to decide the final rules for the kyoto protocol, which should enter into force by 2002, giving governments adequate time to reduce emissions. “solving global warming is only as complicated as governments want to make it,” said jennifer morgan, director of the climate change campaign. chabitats at risk. global warming could fundamentally alter one-third of plant and animal habitats by the end of this century – and cause the eventual extinction of certain plant and animal species, according to a wwf report, global warming and terrestrial biodiversity decline, released in august. in the northern latitudes of canada, russia, and scandinavia, where warming is predicted to be most rapid, up to 70 per cent of habitats could be lost. other parts of these countries – and parts of kyrgyzstan, finland, latvia, uruguay, bhutan, and mongolia – are likely to lose 45 per cent or more of current habitat. as global warming accelerates, plants and animals will be under increasing pressure to migrate to find suitable habitat – and some will not be able to move fast enough. species most at risk include the rare gelada baboon in ethiopia, the mountain pygmy possum of australia,the monarch butterfly at its mexican wintering grounds, and the spoon-billed sandpiper at its breeding sites in russia’s arctic far east.
