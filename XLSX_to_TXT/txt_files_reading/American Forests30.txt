 planted more than 45,000 disease-resistant whitebark pine trees within the iconic greater yellowstone area (gya). provided free pheromone patches to private land owners to help protect high-value mature whitebark pines from bark beetle infestation. supported the collection of cones from naturally disease-resistant whitebark pines, which could produce up to 786,000 seedlings, reforesting as many as 3,500 acres. partnered on the development of a model that will help identify how climate change will impact the whitebark pine throughout the gya and beyond.
