 on whychus creek in the deschutes river basin of central oregon, nfwf’s columbia basin water transaction program (cbwtp) has helped fund the deschutes river conservancy’s permanent restoration of 10 cubic feet per second (cfs) of the 20 cfs target established by the oregon department of fish and wildlife (odfw) for the stream above and through the town of sisters, oregon. flow is being restored to benefit summer steelhead that have been re-introduced to whychus creek after a decades-long absence due to a downstream barrier on the deschutes river. by the summer of 2008, the deschutes river conservancy will have achieved half of the target through the retirement of agricultural water rights and water conservation projects with three sisters irrigation district. when annual water leasing is combined with permanent transfers, odfw’s 20 cfs minimum flow is exceeded.
