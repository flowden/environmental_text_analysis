 in february 2012, with a grant from the bill & melinda gates foundation, ci launched vital signs—a groundbreaking system for monitoring ecosystem health, agricultural productivity and human well-being in ghana, tanzania, uganda and other regions of sub-saharan africa. the raw data and decision-support tools produced by vital signs will provide policymakers with a better understanding of the opportunities and tradeoffs that come with increased agricultural production—so that we can feed the world now, and for generations.
