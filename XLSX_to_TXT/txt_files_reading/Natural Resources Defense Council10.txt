 change cannot come soon enough. not when the world could face catastrophic levels of warming by the end of the century. not with economies reeling from the worst hardships in decades and when millions of people are delaying or forgoing necessary medical care because they simply can't afford it. but change is already before us. in every community across the country, we see people pushing for a more sustainable, healthier, and more lucrative path forward; people demanding cleaner buildings and transportation, more connected neighbor- hoods, job training for a green economy, and investment in natural climate solutions right under our feet. the best and fiercest advocates to help build that bridge are all around us. they are the ones seeing the impacts of climate change in their daily lives and pushing solutions in their own communities. our job is to listen, to amplify, and to partner with these voices for climate justice. the movement is stronger when we speak as one.
