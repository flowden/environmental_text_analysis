 goal: to restore fisheries to abundance, make catch shares the standard approach. why: catch shares empower fishermen to be stewards, boosting profits and fish populations. our objectives by 2015: 1/ catch shares are in place for most fish caught in federal waters (already achieved). 2 / catch share fisheries are on track to recover. 3/ catch shares are tested for the first time in recreational fisheries.
