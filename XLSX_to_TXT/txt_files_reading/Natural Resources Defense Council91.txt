 the world cannot afford to waver on climate action and clean energy a moment longer. regardless of president trump’s attempts to thwart u.s. climate progress—his shameless abandonment of the paris climate agreement, repeal of the clean power plan, and support for expanding reliance on fossil fuels—momentum is not on his side. millions of citizens, thousands of businesses, and countless real leaders across the united states and around the globe are forging ahead, upholding their moral obligations to lower carbon pollution, and supporting local policies that build a better future for our children. together, we are keeping the promise of paris alive.
