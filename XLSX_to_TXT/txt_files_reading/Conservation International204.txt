 more than 40 percent of the african continent is rangeland â€” but encroaching settlements, land-tenure policies and climate change have left it overused, degraded and beset by human-wildlife conflict. conservation international is working with communal farmers in high-biodiversity rural areas of south africa to help degraded rangelands recover and become more resilient to climate change, while improving cattle health and providing access to new markets for farmers. the herding 4 health program, an ambitious partnership between conservation international and the peace parks foundation, aims to expand this work to cover more than 1.5 million hectares (3.7 million acres) of rangeland under improved management across at least five countries over the next five years. herding 4 health uses a community-driven approach to address challenges faced by farmers living within and next to protected areas. in southern africa, the integrated program will incorporate lessons learned from the south africa rangeland program, while also focusing on human-wildlife conflict and novel approaches to animal disease control, as well as market access in partnership with local organization meat naturally.
