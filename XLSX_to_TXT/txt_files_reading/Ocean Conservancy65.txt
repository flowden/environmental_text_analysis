 during the 25th anniversary year of our international coastal cleanup, ocean conservancy not only celebrated the remarkable growth and success of the world’s largest volunteer effort for ocean health, but also expanded our leadership role in the global movement to solve the problem of ocean trash. in the spring, ocean conservancy released our yearly report on the results of the cleanup. the report, trash travels: from our hands to the sea and around the globe, provides country-by- country, location-by-location, and item-by-item details, and also explains how water-borne trash moves all over the world, impacting us all. the weeks following the bp deepwater horizon oil disaster presented an unexpected opportunity to make a difference for the gulf of mexico: working with our network of volunteer coordinators, we helped organize cleanups to remove trash on gulf beaches where oil had not yet made landfall, preventing it from becoming oil- contaminated waste. from there, momentum grew for thousands of international coastal cleanup events in the fall. all told, more than 600,000 volunteers came out to pick up trash in 2010, from landlocked places like beatrice, nebraska, to the coast of ghana in west africa. the data collected by hundreds of thousands of volunteers throughout the world provide a critical snapshot of a ubiquitous problem. as we moved into our 25th year, we expanded our reach. in addition to our global cleanup movement, we have focused on the need for more science, more collaboration, and more communication about this major pollution problem. in september, we hosted a marine debris summit with our partner the coca-cola company, bringing together some of the best and brightest representatives from government, industry, academia, and nonprofits to collaborate on successful strategies. we’re moving forward with the knowledge that, working with partners, we can stop the tide of trash and promote greater ocean health.
