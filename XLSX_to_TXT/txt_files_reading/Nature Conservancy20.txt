 for more than a decade, the nature conservancy offered key support in the creation of canada’s newest protected area, thaidene nëné—6.5 million acres of beautiful forest, lakes and a new national park reserve. wolves, bears, lynx and iconic herds of free-ranging caribou are all found in the protected area, located below the arctic circle in the northwest territories. but most importantly, thaidene nëné protects the traditional homelands and ancestral rights of the łutsël k’é dene first nation. the nature conservancy and its canadian affiliate, nature united, helped the łutsël k’é dene achieve their conservation vision by sharing technical expertise, supporting a variety of community-led development programs and raising funds that will enable them to manage the land. the community will co-govern thaidene nëné with federal and territorial governments in an unprecedented partnership that sets a new global standard for conservation. thaidene nëné, together with the neighboring thelon wildlife sanctuary, will protect an ecological system spanning more than 18 million acres, creating one of the largest terrestrial protected areas in north america.
