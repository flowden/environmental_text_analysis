 to meet its ambitious climate goals, the united states must transform its antiquated electric grid. today, a jumble of obsolete rules encourages utilities to build more power plants, impeding progress toward a clean energy future. that’s why edf is working in key states that make up half the u.s. electricity market. here are examples of what we’re doing. edf goals • rewrite old rules to reward conservation and clean energy • modernize the electric grid so it’s intelligent and interactive • empower customers to make smart energy choices • spur private investment in energy efficiency and renewables ca: in 2016, edf helped extend climate change legislation that we co-sponsored in 2006. the new law requires emissions to be cut 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. oh: edf beat back firstenergy’s proposed $12 billion bailout that would have kept aging coal plants running at customers’ expense. ny: regulators adopted edf’s proposals to link utilities’ earnings to emissions cuts and to open the energy system to clean-tech innovation. nc: we helped create new ways to finance energy-saving retrofits for members of rural electricity cooperatives, many of whom are low-income. il: edf helped develop a first-of-its-kind metric that will link a major utility’s earnings to its greenhouse gas reductions. tx: pecan street inc., a test bed for clean energy innovation co-founded by edf, advances smart grid technology.
