 since the election of donald trump, concerned people across the country have joined the environmental and broader social justice movement, growing the sierra club’s base of members and supporters to more than 3 million for the first time ever. leveraging this powerful base, the sierra club’s work in 2017 built a more powerful, inclusive movement with the strength and agility to counter the trump administration’s regressive rhetoric and policies. we are connecting environmentalism with the broader struggle for justice and equity in all the work we support. no longer can our work stand alone—we must join together and speak out against racism, xenophobia, sexism, bigotry, and hate. in the first 100 days of trump’s presidency, the sierra club helped organize and promote resistance marches, events, and actions. in just the first 100 hours, 150 actions—vigils and press conferences—took place in 38 states. we contributed resources to support the women’s march, the immigration rally, and many other movement-building events. to mark the end of the first 100 days, the people’s climate march mobilized hundreds of thousands of protesters nationwide to demand climate action, gaining international attention. the march’s impact was enhanced by a focus on the arts, speakers from frontline communities, and local stories of resistance and hope. many successes in 2017 were the result of thoughtful, meaningful partnerships with tribal nations. the sierra club listened first, prioritized community needs, and supported tribal-led efforts as requested. respect and mutuality strengthened relationships with the lummi nation and the moapa band of paiutes, leading to clean energy victories, such as preventing the cherry point coal export terminal and replacing the reid gardner coal plant with utility-scale solar.
