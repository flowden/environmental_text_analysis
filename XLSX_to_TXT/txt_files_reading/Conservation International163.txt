 in the coastal village of la ensenada, colombia, where digging for shellfish is a way of life, everyone must learn to swim — even little dulce. but as the effects of climate change, marked by swelling tides and shrinking coastlines, begin to threaten the village’s livelihood, the swimming lessons led by dulce’s mother take on a sense of urgency. “dulce,” a short documentary film by conservation international, brings her story to the world. screen ed at the 2018 palm springs international shortfest, the 2018 toronto international film festival and the new york times op-docs video channel — and selected to screen at the sundance film festival in 2019 — “dulce” was co-directed by guille isa and angello faccini, produced by filmmakers jungles in paris and executive-produced by actor and activist lee pace. the film arrives at a promising moment for our work in this south american country. from advising on the recent expansion of a marine protected area there to establishing a new trust fund to protect the country’s diverse coastal species and communities, conservation international provides the science and support to make dulce’s future — and colombia’s — more sustainable.
