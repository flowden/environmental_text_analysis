 when wwf alerted our members and supporters about a crisis facing sumatra’s tiger-sheltering rain forests, those supporters took action. they searched stores, hotels and schools across the u.s. for paseo- and livi-brand tissue and other paper products made with tissue from asia pulp & paper (app), a company using extremely unsustainable forestry practices. wwf sought the help of consumers only after it became clear that a decade’s worth of other pressures on app were not working to change the company’s practices. our outreach campaign appealed for help from individual supporters and action by grocery chains. the campaign was built around a public report in which we listed the 20 grocery chains believed to be the biggest sellers of paseo toilet paper in the u.s. wwf contacted the retailers individually, asking them to take action. within four weeks, 17 of those companies confirmed in writing that they had decided to stop purchasing the brand. among the many consumer actions, one wwf member identified paseo-brand toilet paper at stores in minnesota, north dakota and south dakota, and urged managers at the store and corporate levels to consider the impact of paseo sales. eventually, the chain dropped the brand from their shelves. today, paseo has been discontinued in the united states and wwf continues to push app to reform its destructive forestry practices.
