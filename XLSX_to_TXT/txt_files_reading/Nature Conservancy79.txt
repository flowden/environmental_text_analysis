 the lands and waters of north america do not just provide us with food, clothing and shelter, they also define us as a people. from the “purple mountain majesties” that inspired american patriotism to the caribbean’s crystal waters that unite island nations to the coastal rainforests of canada where people have lived for more than 10,000 years, north america’s natural systems have shaped cultures and built countries. but as our communities and economies grow, so does the pressure on these systems. the future of life depends on how we grow our food, develop our energy, use our water and build our cities. science tells us that the only way to save nature is to also address the challenges facing people. the nature conservancy began in north america 65 years ago, and our long history with the people, businesses and governments across the region make us well suited to take on these challenges. as climate change increases the risk of floods and damaging storms, we are working with engineering firms and government agencies to use natural solutions—such as restoring tidal marshes and oyster reefs—to shield people and support wildlife. with energy development having the potential to impact 50 million acres across the united states, we are working with businesses to protect our most fragile and important natural areas while also supporting innovation to create affordable clean energy. as the demand for food increases, the conservancy is partnering with farmers and agriculture businesses to improve practices that protect north america’s fertile lands and waters while feeding an ever-growing population. and with more than 80 percent of americans living in urban areas, we are partnering with local communities to demonstrate how nature can help cities thrive and urban populations can play an essential role in sustaining the lands and waters on which all life depends.”
