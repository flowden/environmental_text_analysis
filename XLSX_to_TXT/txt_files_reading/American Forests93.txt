 american forests began 2009 like most non-profit organizations, with a sense of apprehension due to a sluggish global and national economy, but also with a sense of excitement. there was broad enthusiasm on capitol hill for advancing innovative approaches to build a green economy and a framework for addressing the potential impacts of climate change. the year was fast-paced and inspiring, as members, sponsors, and partners of american forests demonstrated strong support for our tree planting activities, our policy efforts to build and assist a broad base of community-based forest advocates, and our educational efforts to heighten awareness and understanding of the life- sustaining services that healthy forest ecosystems provide in both urban and rural areas. we marked the 115th year of publishing american forests magazine with coverage of cutting- edge topics, as well as our ongoing initiatives and new projects. we earned charity accreditation from the better business bureau, an a- from the american institute of philanthropy, and a four star rating from charity navigator.
