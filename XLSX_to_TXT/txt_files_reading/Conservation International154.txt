 almost half of humanity relies on seafood as a primary source of animal protein â€” and half of all seafood is produced in aquaculture farms. compared with other forms of animal production, fish farming is more efficient and environmentally friendly, yet rapid growth and expansion of intensive aquaculture has resulted in widespread environmental degradation from pollution, waste and habitat destruction. to help produce more sustainably farmed seafood, conservation international is developing science-based best practices for the aquaculture sector. by partnering with governments, civil society and companies, ci aims to enable strong governance and private-sector transformation to help develop a responsible aquaculture industry. done right, aquaculture can have minimal environmental impacts while increasing opportunities for economic development, job creation and food security.
