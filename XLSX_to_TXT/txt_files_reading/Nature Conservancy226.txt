 by the early 1970s, the conservancy was undertaking much more complex transactions, and mississippi’s pascagoula river was a milestone that propelled the conservancy’s work in several productive directions. pascagoula hardwood company owned 42,000 acres of forest and wetlands along the river. valued at $22 million, sole conservancy acquisition of the property was unaffordable. instead, the conservancy worked on two fronts, assisting the state game and fish department in drafting legislation to create the mississippi wildlife heritage committee to fund the protection of wildlife habitat — a first for the state. with the committee’s support, the conservancy then purchased 75 percent of pascagoula hardwood stock and gained title to 32,000 acres of pascagoula swamp, which it transferred to the mississippi wildlife heritage committee for $15 million. spurred by the success of the pascagoula project, the conservancy in 1981 launched its bold rivers of the deep south program to protect some 350,000 acres of bottomland hardwood forest along six major southern rivers.
