 in the philippines, community buy-in is essential, not only to create reforms that last, but also to ensure the support of legislators, who must approve any reforms. so for 18 months, our partners held dozens of meetings in local communities. the result: three pilot projects to establish fishing rights programs combined with marine reserves. residents of the island of ayoke came up with an ingenious solution to avoid potential fishing conflicts, by establishing two ringshaped fishing areas around their island. island fishermen are granted exclusive fishing access to the inner kilometer, while fishermen from other villages who agree to adhere to the rules, which include spawning closures and gear restrictions, are granted access to the outer kilometer. the reduction in fishing effort allows fish stocks to recover. “we’d never been so included before,” said analou lumapguid, a community leader. “after all those meetings, debates and even times when some of us cried, we now see the results of our efforts.” sixteen other sites are now in the final stages of design.
