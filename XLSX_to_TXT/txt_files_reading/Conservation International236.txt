 wildlife trafficking is often hidden in plain sight, with illegally traded species falsely listed as — or hidden among — legal ones being shipped around the world. most customs authorities, meanwhile, are overmatched in the face of this massive and relentless trade, with millions of animals and animal parts moving through ports around the world every day. a new tool being developed by conservation international and partners could change that. nature intelligence system is an artificial intelligence system that any organization involved in the movement of wildlife — government agencies, customs authorities, the pet trade, the shipping sector and more — can use to help differentiate between legal and illegal shipments. the platform synthesizes data and documents about exporters, species, market values and more to flag suspicious shipments for inspectors. conservation international is working with a few select countries to pilot the system and expand it to some of the world’s busiest ports.
