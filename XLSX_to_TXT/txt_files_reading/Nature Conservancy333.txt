 in 2006, the conservancy and coiab, the largest indigenous federation of the amazon, launched the amazon indigenous training center (or cafi) as a pilot initiative for conserving indigenous lands, which make up nearly 22 percent of the amazon basin in brazil. cafiâ€™s mission is to strengthen local and regional indigenous organizations by training indigenous technicians who will work in land management in their own territories. the instructors are trained specialists in topics important in meeting the current demands faced by indigenous communities in conservation and development. after their seven-month training in manaus, brazil, the students return to their areas of origin to put their new technical knowledge to practice.
