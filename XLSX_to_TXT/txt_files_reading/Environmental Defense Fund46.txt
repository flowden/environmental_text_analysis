 japan, the world’s seventh-largest fishing nation, has seen its catch plummet by two-thirds in the past three decades, in large part due to overfishing. the country has a huge stake in improving seafood sustainability: japanese fish consumption per capita is nearly triple the global average. to help fisheries recover, japan’s lawmakers have enacted the most significant reform of their fisheries laws in 70 years. edf provided broad scientific and policy guidance to government officials, scientists and regulators. the new law incorporates edf recommendations including greater reliance on science-based catch limits and a requirement to develop recovery plans for overfished stocks. “these changes could signal a shift in how other countries in the asia-pacific region manage their fisheries,” says edf japan director kazuhiko otsuka. new research by edf scientists and allies, published in marine policy, suggests that the reforms could increase fish populations in japan’s waters and generate an additional $5.5 billion in annual profits for fishermen by 2065. says otsuka, “our research shows that fishermen and fish can both do better if we offer fishermen incentives to conserve and get the management right.”
