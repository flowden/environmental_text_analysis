 for the world’s most vulnerable communities, “green” infrastructure — nature itself — is the most cost-effective and efficient way to address the impacts of climate change. yet as the effects of climate change mount, we must find new ways to avert damage from climate-related natural disasters. by combining elements of traditional “gray” engineering with nature-based “green” infrastructure, conservation international is developing the next generation of climate adaptation, building effective protection from climate impacts while preserving the benefits that nature provides to people. in 2017, ci launched a “green-gray” infrastructure project in the philippines that prioritizes conservation and ecosystem services while providing climate protection. announced at the 2017 our ocean conference alongside bechtel corporation and the massachusetts institute of technology, this pioneering solution will hit the ground in 2018, combining coral reef protection, mangrove restoration and an engineered breakwater in a promising pilot project.
