 in one of the largest cafeteria waste audit samples collected to date, wwf—with support from the kroger co. foundation and the epa—analyzed waste from students’ plates in 46 schools in nine us cities across eight states. the study found that national food waste in schools could reach an estimated 530,000 tons per year—but also that participating schools were able to reduce their food waste by an average of 3% in just four months. if schools nationwide could reduce food waste by the same amount, that would be equivalent to taking more than 12,000 cars off the road for one year.
