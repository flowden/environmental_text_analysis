 this cohesive mix of efforts positioned ci to work with governments and multilaterals of every size in fy09—from the united states and china to madagascar, suriname, the world bank and the coalition for rainforest nations—to establish the foundation for economies that leverage the true importance of ecosystem services to long-term economic growth. in partnership with national leadership, ci helped develop suriname’s “green vision” strategy, which will generate revenue to keep the country’s forests standing. ci’s team of economists and scientists, along with other partners, advised the national leaders of guyana on the development of a “low carbon development strategy” designed to protect forests, and the use of revenue from the carbon market to finance the development of infrastructure goals ranging from health initiatives to sustainable fisheries. ci also assisted guyana as it secured significant funding from norway for the strategy’s implementation. in liberia, ci economists have been working with the government and partner organizations to analyze the costs and benefits of different green development scenarios (including low carbon economic opportunities), and to link the benefits of nature to liberia’s long-term national poverty reduction plan.
