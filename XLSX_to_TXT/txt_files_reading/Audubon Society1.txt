 audubon’s work requires a broad- based approach, from a global scale down to the community level. but whether it’s conserving wintering habitat in a far-flung part of our hemisphere or connecting kids to nature at an audubon center, it’s all crucial to our mission. as you read this report, you will see the many ways we accomplish our work. look at our sensible approach to the siting of wind farms. our work with multiple partners—government agencies, other conservation groups, and the wind industry—led to the creation of historic wind-farm guidelines that maximize protection for birds. and look at how we’re deploying our legal team to contest shell’s reckless plans to drill for oil off northern alaska. our community work is no less valuable, whether it’s tucson audubon’s program to make the city’s barrio lane neighborhood more welcoming for birds and people, or the audubon center at debs park’s internship program, which is finding the next generation of conservation leaders in its own east los angeles neighborhood. the challenges we face are daunting— none more so than the threat of global climate change. but based on our recent successes, and on our clear, strategic vision of a better future, i believe no group has the passion and potential to address these challenges that audubon does. thanks for your past support. i look forward to working with you in the future.
