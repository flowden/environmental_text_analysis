 conservation international is a founding partner of the ocean health index, the first assessment tool that scientifically measures key elements from all dimensions of the ocean’s health — biological, physical, economic and social — to assess how sustainably people are using the ocean. more than 65 scientists and partners worked together to develop the index, which provides an annual assessment of ocean health using information from over 120 scientific databases. we work to update scientific methodology with the latest techniques, produce annual updates and work with governments and universities to apply the index on a regional or local scale.
