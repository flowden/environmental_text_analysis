 the nature conservancy launched the plant a billion trees campaign (plantabillion.org) to reforest brazil’s atlantic forest, which has been reduced to just 7% of its original range. working with brazilian agencies and local communities, the campaign also enables people to participate online. these efforts will be counted as part of the united nations environment programme’s goal to plant a billion trees a year around the world. besides protecting wildlife habitat and water supplies, this reforestation will remove 10 million tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year, the equivalent of taking 2 million cars off the road.
