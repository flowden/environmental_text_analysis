 worked with states on the east coast to fight ocean acidification because of carbon dioxide emissions, the ocean is becoming more acidic, damaging the ability of shell-forming organisms like oysters, clams and others to make their shells and wreaking havoc on shellfish industries and communities that rely upon them. building on successful west coast efforts, we celebrated victories in maine and maryland with passage of legislation to establish panels (like the successful one in washington state) to take local action on ocean acidification. ocean conservancy is now talking with massachusetts, virginia and florida to encourage similar measures and working with a coalition of pacific states and british columbia on a carbon pricing plan that could help reduce acidification.
