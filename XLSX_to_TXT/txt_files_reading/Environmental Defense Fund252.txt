 for more than a decade, edf has been working with cuban scientists on issues ranging from coral reef conservation to sustainable coastal development. with cuba slowly opening the door to private enterprise, safeguards are critically needed. edf helped lay the foundation for a network of marine protected areas and is now working to strengthen protections for the legendary gardens of the queen national marine park, which teems with giant fish uncommon elsewhere in the caribbean. weâ€™re also partnering with cuban government officials and fishermen to rebuild important fisheries through the development of community-based fishery cooperatives to achieve our joint economic and conservation goals.
