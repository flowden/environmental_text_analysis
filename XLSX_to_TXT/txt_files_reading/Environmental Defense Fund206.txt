 goal: cut emissions of climate accelerants. why: short-lived but potent greenhouse gases—“climate accelerants” such as methane and some fluorinated gases—have an outsized impact on global warming. contribution to global warming: 16%* (but up to 38% on 20-year horizon) our objectives by 2015: 1/ studies quantify methane leakage in the u.s. natural gas supply chain. 2 / major reductions in methane emissions from the supply chain are secured, and are on track to be reduced to 1% or less. 3/ california’s carbon market incorporates methane reductions from rice farming. 4 / epa tightens limits on methane from landfills and oil and gas operations.
