 one of the surest ways to prevent catastrophic wildfires is the active removal of excess fuels, including dead trees as well as live ones packed too tightly together from plantation plantings. due to the vastness of the forests and rugged terrain in californiaâ€™s national forests, nfwf and the u.s. forest service work together to identify areas that would provide the greatest protection to wildlife, water and human communities. we concentrate our conservation investments in those areas. examples of our 2020 grant-making include: a grant of nearly $5.5 million will enable the california fire safe council to develop a comprehensive assessment of wildfire risk and vulnerability in santa barbara county and establish long-term wildfire resilience of watersheds and human communities. the mid klamath watershed council will leverage a $500,000 grant to conduct manual thinning around communities within the six rivers national forest of northern california and implement fuels reduction treatment along strategic fuel breaks. a grant of more than $321,000 will enable the american conservation experience to reduce the risk of severe wildfires within the san gabriel mountains national monument. the nonprofit will provide training to a fuels reduction crew that will implement necessary fuels treatments to promote forest health and resilience. the student conservation association will use a grant of $212,000 to reduce wildfire risk near communities on frazier mountain in the los padres national forest. the restoration team of mostly young adults, many from nearby urban communities, will perform thinning and other treatments on 1,500 acres.
