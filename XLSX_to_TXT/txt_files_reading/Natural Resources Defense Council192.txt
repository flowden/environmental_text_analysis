 nrdc’s experts and advocates are working to ensure that every agency uses its clout under existing law to deliver as much clean energy as possible. as a result of sound research and strong advocacy by nrdc, the u.s. department of energy has issued more new energy efficiency standards in the last two years than any other administration in history. in 2010, for instance, with backing from nrdc and our allies, the department of energy issued a new federal standard for residential water heaters and other heating equipment that will cut water heater energy use in half, reducing carbon emissions by 160 million tons and saving consumers $10 billion over the next 30 years. also in 2010, nrdc and allies announced an agreement on energy and water efficiency standards for “white goods” appliances, such as dishwashers and refrigerators, that will save 5 trillion gallons of water and billions of consumer dollars over the next 30 years, reducing carbon emissions by 550 million metric tons. that’s enough energy to meet the total energy needs of 40 percent of american homes for one year. the environmental protection agency has issued its own rules to reduce harmful pollution from power plants and industrial facilities. the coal industry is trying to block this effort—a move that would benefit polluters, but not american families. stopping the epa would undermine the clean air act, a law that has saved hundreds of thousands of lives. nrdc won’t let that happen. we’ve beaten back previous attacks on the epa both in court and in congress, and we will succeed again by running a full-throttle campaign to preserve this tool and protect the integrity of the clean air act.
