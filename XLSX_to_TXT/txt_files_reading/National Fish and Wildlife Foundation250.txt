 skyrocketing fuel costs, competition from shrimp farms, and the devastation of recent hurricanes have hurt texas shrimpers. in addition, shrimping takes a tremendous toll on the marine environment in the form of bycatchâ€”species other than shrimp that are caught in the trawls. many of these species die in the process, and the waste is staggering. on average, every one pound of shrimp caught results in 1.5 to 11 .8 pounds of bycatch. these conditions created an opportunity to help the ecosystem upon which both shrimp and fisherman depend. through an innovative texas parks and wildlife department (tpwd) program funded in part by nfwf through the shell marine habitat program, shrimpers are offered cash to retire their commercial licenses. with fewer shrimpers on the water, remaining shrimpers have less competition, a shot at increased profits and a stabilized shrimp fishery. since the beginning of the shrimp license buyback program in 1996, tpwd has retired 1,187 of 3,231 licenses on the books at a cost of $7.2 million. and the overall number of inshore shrimp vessels in texas waters has decreased from around 2,100 to nearly 1,200. the remaining shrimpers are doing quite nicely. catch per unit of effort is up as much as 100% compared to historic lows. the license buyback program has also reduced bycatch by 40%. marine scientists are reporting increased croaker and blue crab populations and sea turtle strandings have been reduced from 600 to 200 annually.
