 the longleaf pine forests of america’s southeast once covered more than 90 million acres—today only about 3% remains. it’s inconceivable that we’ll ever have anything approaching historical forests again, but through a 10-year partnership with southern company and its operating companies (alabama, georgia, gulf, and mississippi powers), nfwf is protecting viable remaining forests and restoring patches with a vision for a longleaf ecosystem that recreates the magical forests described by early explorers. restoration priorities are being identified through the leadership of the east gulf coastal plain joint venture, using data on vulnerable bird species characteristic of longleaf forests. numerous partners, including the georgia department of natural resources, alabama wildlife federation, and the u.s. fish and wildlife service are tackling the restoration effort. one key strategy involves converting non-native plantations of loblolly pine back to the preferred longleaf. in some cases, longleaf is planted beneath more mature loblolly pine forests. as the non-native loblolly pines are harvested for income, the already established longleaf gets a jump-start on growth.
