 changes to the earthâ€™s climate and the chemical composition of its seas represent fundamental threats to corals. however, some of the most urgent threats come not from air or water, but from land. waters running off city streets and agricultural lands carry excess nutrients, harmful chemicals and sedimentation onto nearshore coral reefs. we build partner coalitions around priority reef strongholds and establish the framework for their stabilization and recovery through comprehensive threat reduction. these concentrated investments mobilize and focus resources where efforts can generate real-world results. in 2020 we prioritized three reefs in hawaii that provide seed-stock to the surrounding reefs of three islands for this comprehensive approach. grant examples include: a grant of $269,000 will enable the ridge to reefs organization to work with managers and local partners to reduce runoff to all three reefs (west and south maui and lanai) through vegetation buffers, sediment retention areas, and a new method in hawaii for secondary sewage treatment that will reduce harmful nutrient runoff. the coral reef alliance will use a grant of $84,000 to address land-based pollution from sedimentation in the west maui, hawaii focal area by working with agricultural land owners to reduce erosion from dirt roads on the steep slopes of their agricultural fields. the nature conservancy will use a grant of $71,000 to establish a baseline of the nearshore fish and coral communities along the northeast coast of lanai, hawaii and establish sedimentation flow patterns that will prioritize ungulate control efforts in the neighboring watersheds to reduce sediment run-off.
