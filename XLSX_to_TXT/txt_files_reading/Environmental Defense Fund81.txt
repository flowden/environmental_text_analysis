 rich mississippi river sediments once replenished louisiana’s coastal wetlands. but in recent decades, we’ve turned the river into a walled canal that shoots sediments out to sea. as a result, the state has lost 2,000 square miles of land, putting at risk millions of people, wildlife, and an economy driven by the seafood, shipping and energy industries. harnessing the mississippi’s power is key to a coastal restoration master plan that the state developed with edf’s help. the plan’s first such project, the mid-barataria sediment diversion, will restore wetlands by piping in silt-laden river water. edf convened 60 scientists, coastal planners and others to help louisiana manage such sediment diversions. we also mobilized more than 200 businesses to endorse the plan. to restore the coastline sooner and at lower cost, we demonstrated that environmental impact bonds, which pay returns based on environmental outcomes, can be attractive to private investors. we are also sharing our work with planners in other u.s. coastal areas that experience severe flooding.
