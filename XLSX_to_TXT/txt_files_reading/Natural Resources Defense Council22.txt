 nrdc continued to advance our advocacy and institutional priorities in 2020, despite the challenges stemming from the covid-19 pandemic. one of our top priorities is the safety and well-being of our staff. we have changed our ways of working to help limit the spread of the coronavirus and protect the health of our communities. all nrdc employees- from beijing to delhi to the united states have been working remotely, and our us. offices remain closed as of the time this publication went to press. staff are equipped to work from their homes. and we are providing flexible time to ensure that they are supported in caring for their families and themselves. we have also suspended all business travel and canceled all in person events. our financial position remains strong. nrdc has taken several steps to strengthen our financial position and maintain financial liquidity, including reducing expenses across functional areas, increasing the draw from our endowment and reserve funds, and broadening new donor cultivation activities to offset potential declines in fundraising revenues and investment returns.
