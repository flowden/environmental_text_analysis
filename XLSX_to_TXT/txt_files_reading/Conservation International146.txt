 in recent years, an african elephant was slaughtered every 15 minutes for its ivory. in response, conservation international has partnered with governments and organizations across africa to combat poaching and wildlife trafficking on multiple fronts. ci serves as co-secretariat of the elephant protection initiative (epi), an african-led coalition standing against the international trade in elephant ivory. the 18 african nations of the epi are home to more than 200,000 elephants — 60 percent of the continent’s total. under broad-based international pressure, ivory markets in china, the united states, the european union and the u.k. have closed in the past two years, with more nations considering similar bans. within communities, ci is working to ensure that wildlife protection coincides with sustainable development. in kenya, with support from glassybaby and other partners, ci helped launch the reteti elephant sanctuary — the first communityowned elephant sanctuary in east africa. and through the sarara initiative, we are helping to strengthen security for elephants and people in kenya’s namunyak wildlife conservancy by establishing a rapidresponse ranger unit in 2017 and supporting the well-being of rangers and their families with ongoing assistance.
