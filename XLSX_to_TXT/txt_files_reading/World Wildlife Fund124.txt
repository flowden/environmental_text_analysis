 the inupiat village of point hope in northwest alaska belongs to a region that has been threatened by the prospect of offshore oil and gas drilling. that prospect ground to a halt on december 20, 2016, when then president barack obama announced a permanent ban on oil and gas drilling throughout nearly 180,000 square miles of the arctic ocean. wwf and 225,000 of its supporters fought for that protective measure. oil and gas drilling is extremely unsafe in such a remote location and could cause massive damage to the regionâ€™s indigenous communities, wildlife, and ecosystems. given those realities, wwf will continue working to keep the ban intact to protect this extremely valuable landscape for future generations.
