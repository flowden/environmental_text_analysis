 in the us, we import more than 5.3 billion pounds of seafood every year. unfortunately, much of that seafood cannot be traced back to its source—and much of it is illegally caught. in fact, illegal fishing is rampant and current traceability laws are not strong—so us consumers cannot know whether their seafood was caught legally. | but thanks to a concerted effort by the us government, wwf, and hundreds of thousands of wwf supporters, all that is beginning to change. over the past year and a half, a task force formed by a white house-led initiative, and co chaired by the secretaries of commerce and state, has assessed the situation to combat black-market fishing. | this year, the senate passed the illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing enforcement act of 2015, which sets the stage for president obama to formally commit the united states to the port states measures agreement—a strong, far-reaching tool to fight illegal fishing. the administration also announced a program that uses technology to coordinate and share information that helps trace seafood while strengthening global partnerships among state and local governments, the seafood industry, and nongovernmental organizations. real progress toward legally traceable fishing is being made. to stop illegal and unreported seafood from entering the us market, wwf engaged key government stakeholders around a us policy of legality and traceability—and saw new, positive guidelines put in place. michele kuruc, vice president for oceans policy, visits a seafood market in washington, dc. wwf’s advocacy on the issue was vital to engaging government leaders on the reality of illegal fishing's impact on us consumers and fishing communities.
