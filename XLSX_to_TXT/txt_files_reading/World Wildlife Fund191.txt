 after years of analysis, wwf finished compiling arcnet, the worldâ€™s most in-depth database of arctic biodiversity. by identifying the locations of species populations (including marine mammals, seabirds, and fish), scientists mapped a network of priority areas for marine conservation. arcnet facilitates ocean planning to meet the needs of arctic wildlife like the walrus, gray whales, and beluga whales of the bering strait.
