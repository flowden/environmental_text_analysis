 edf has long fought to limit toxic mercury from power plants, culminating in a strong 2011 epa rule that will safeguard the health of children. most power plants now comply with the mercury rule, but opponents went to court, and edf stepped in to fight for the rule. in 2015, the u.s. supreme court directed epa to re-evaluate the costs of the rule, which epa will soon address.
